This edited collection was conceived in the spring of 2019 as the fourth edition  
of Technical Writing 101, a book that was originally published in three editions 
by  Scriptorium  and  written  by  Alan  Pringle  and  Sarah  O’Keefe.  Since  those 
initial days of this project, Sarah has remained a key player despite the COVID-
19 pandemic and many changes to the book’s structure and content. Sarah and 
many of the current and former staff members at Scriptorium deserve credit 
for significant work behind this volume. Above all, the contributors who gen-
erously  wrote  chapters  for  an  open-access  publication  deserve  recognition 
for responding to my pitch of “this book won’t make you rich, but it will help 
explain the concept of Content Operations in industry and academia.” Patrick 
Bosek was a very important force and moved the project forward. Rahel Bailie 
is a kind and knowledgeable colleague who became an excellent coauthor and 
gave me more than one content master class during our many Zoom meetings. 
At Virginia Tech Publishing, Peter Potter, Anita Walz, and Corinne Guimont  
championed  the  project,  with  patience,  for  years.  Rebekka  Andersen,  Alan 
Houser, Jimmy Ivory, Tim Lockridge, and Kelly Pender helped me with quick 
answers, opinions, and overall encouragement during the editing process. This 
collection would not exist without the support and care of Jane Robertson Evia 
and Sofia Evia.

I was walking down Wall Street in Lower Manhattan one morning, on my way 
to a meeting.

The New York Stock Exchange is at the corner of Wall and Broad. As I passed 
by, in the middle of the street, a film crew was setting up for an “impromptu” 
interview  segment.  The  gaffers  were  wrangling  lighting  equipment,  a  distin-
guished middle-aged man—probably a hedge fund manager or something—
was in the makeup chair, and another man was putting out cones to keep the 
area behind the shot clear.

I went into a coffee shop, waited in line too long, and, as I exited, I noticed 
they were still setting up for this interview. I imagine it was a 30-second spot, 
but they probably spent an hour getting everything ready. It was odd to see the 
interview from a distance, where it looked fairly unremarkable, and to know 
that what would make it onto TV screens would be visually perfect.

And that’s when it occurred to me that TV producers lie for a living.
This hedge fund manager didn’t have a perfect complexion. All the buildings 
made the lighting on this corner pretty awful. And without blocking off the street, 
there would be dozens of random people walking around in the background.

But a producer has to produce. They have to orchestrate and manipulate the 
world so that it looks the way they need it to. They spend an hour preparing to 
lie for 30 seconds.

If you’re reading this book, you probably lie for a living too.
You  create  and  manage  content.  But  the  world  doesn’t  know  much  about 
the “create and manage” part. All the world knows is that wonderful content

magically appears. People don’t know what it takes to make it so, and it’s both 
your professional responsibility and your fervent hope that they never find out.
Consider that one of the secrets of Google Docs is that it tracks and records 
every keystroke. So a Google document isn’t just a snapshot of text at a moment 
in time—it’s actually a history of every keystroke that it took to get the docu-
ment to its current state. Theoretically, you could “rewind” a document through 
every single moment of its creation.

If you’re a writer, you’re probably horrified by this, and I don’t blame you. As 
a content creator, the imprecise, messy, and sometimes cringe-worthy process 
it took to get from blank page to finished product is not something you want 
people to see. You make embarrassing mistakes, you go down blind alleys, you 
ruthlessly kill your darlings, and you’d just rather the world not know about 
this, thank you very much.

Content Operations is all of this, writ large.
Like it or not, behind every amazing piece of content is a long, messy chain 
of humans, processes, events, and tasks that bring it all together. Just like our 
30-second interview segment, which took a dozen people working for an hour, 
there’s a lot of behind-the-scenes work that goes into creating a content engine 
that  generates  assets  your  organization  can  use,  keeps  them  safe  and  secure, 
and produces artifacts from them in a reliable and repeatable process.

I’ve been working in the content technology world for almost 30 years now. 
The way we create and manage content has certainly evolved and improved, but 
there’s a “floor” in how refined the process can ever become. It’s your job to get 
as close to this floor as you can.

Organizations have an unfortunate tendency to throw technology at this prob-
lem,  seeking  the  mythical  nirvana  of  “digital  transformation”  (what  does  that 
even mean?) while ignoring the very real human processes behind the curtain.

You see, one of the beautiful things about content is that it’s a time-shifted 
connection between creator and consumer—two minds coming into a union 
through content. This means there are humans on both sides of the transaction. 
While we put a shocking amount of time into ensuring that our content is con-
sumed as efficiently as possible, we don’t seem to put the same amount of time 
into ensuring that it’s created with the same level of efficiency.

This is like a retail goods manufacturer having the most effective sales pro-
cess in the world but left without anything to sell because no one bothered to 
make sure the factory was turning out goods. In our case, the consumer is king; 
the editors … well, they’ll just figure it out, right?

To understand and refine Content Operations, you need to:

• Know how to define and discuss it
• Be able to articulate the business value of it
• Codify your constraints, rules, and standards into a repeatable framework
• Create and enforce process flows that are rigid enough to guide but flexible 

enough to adapt

Foreword  xi

• Understand the technology environment you and your editors will need to 

operate in

• Make tactical decisions about how to adapt your content to your audience’s 

behavior, culture, and needs

• Effectively manage the sometimes fragile humans who make the entire pro-

cess work

Content  Operations  isn’t  for  the  faint  of  heart.  It’s  often  easier  to  be  a  cog  
in the machine than it is to run the machine. The creative process isn’t always 
clean  and  precise,  and  it  can  probably  never  be  so.  It  embodies  mistakes, 
destruction, and turmoil. In that sense, it’s a snapshot of the human condition.
But content creation and operations is a noble cause. We are the silent serv-
ants, standing in the gap, connecting humans across space and time. We delight 
and entertain. We inform and educate. We motivate and persuade. We light up 
parts of the brain that might otherwise remain dormant.

And, yes, by abstracting away the messiness and making the finished product 

appear effortlessly, like magic, we basically tell lies for a living.

But know that they are grand, beautiful lies. And they make the world a bet-

ter place.

Godspeed and good luck.

Carlos Evia

Content  Operations  (ContentOps)  is  the  implementation  of  a  strat-
egy  that  incorporates  people,  processes,  and  technologies  to  optimize   
content production, so that organizations can leverage their content as 
business assets while retaining content quality.

—Rahel Bailie

I  have  been  a  college  professor,  working  in  the  disciplinary  mixture  that  we 
now call Content Operations or ContentOps, since 2004. Before that, as a doc-
toral student of technical communication at Texas Tech University, I was for-
tunate to take classes with faculty who, in the early 2000s, inspired me to think 
about ways to structure, automate, and improve workflows for developing and 
delivering  digital  information.  Some  of  those  professors  were  committed  to 
exploring  collaborations  between  the  practitioner  and  academic  sides  of  the 
discipline. In my early years as a college professor at Virginia Tech, I inherited  
a course about technical content titled Creating User Documentation. I taught a  
section  of  that  course  in  the  spring  of  2022,  and  some  of  the  principles  in  
Creating User Documentation have not changed much in 18 years. After all, 
fundamentals  of  technical  writing  are  still  important,  practitioners  and  aca-
demics should collaborate, and audience and task analysis are necessary steps 
for any deliverable related to technical content. But many other components 
of the course have evolved as trends and tendencies in industry and academia 
adapt to incorporate new technologies and processes.

2  Content Operations from Start to Scale

Over the years, one of the main resources for updating the content of college 
courses (mine and those of some of my professors in graduate school), and for 
trying to keep up with the fast pace of change in the content disciplines, has 
been the guest lecture. I have never hesitated to invite colleagues from industry 
or other universities to visit my class and talk to the students about new ideas or 
topics that my syllabus was not covering. At the same time, I also did my share 
of guest lecturing, offering an academic perspective within corporate environ-
ments and industry conferences. It is through that mechanism of guest lectures 
that I met Sarah O’Keefe. Back in 2009, I was looking for an industry-based 
speaker to visit my class and talk about the importance of structured authoring 
for technical content. After seeing Sarah give a great presentation on this topic 
at the conference of the Society for Technical Communication, I contacted her, 
and she was generous enough to drive from Raleigh, North Carolina, to Blacks-
burg, Virginia, to talk to a class of 22 students in exchange for lunch and dinner.
Sarah and I stayed in touch and collaborated on a couple of projects, but since 
2013 I had been telling her that I wanted to work with her on a new edition of 
Technical Writing 101—a book that she had coauthored with Alan Pringle. I used 
the three published editions of Technical Writing 101 as a required textbook in 
Creating User Documentation for many years, and even today I am including 
some parts of its template for a documentation plan in my course. The book’s 
third  (and  probably  last)  edition  was  published  in  2009  (Pringle  &  O’Keefe, 
2009), but many of us in the technical communication discipline consider it a 
classic. The promised fourth edition of Technical Writing 101—to be coauthored 
by  Sarah,  Alan,  and  me  as  an  open-access  educational  resource—became  an 
ongoing conversation when I talked to Sarah at conferences or on Twitter. 

In 2019, I had a couple of meetings with Sarah at a conference of the Center 
for Information Development Management in North Carolina, and we finally 
started  drafting  a  fourth  edition  of  Technical  Writing  101.  Nevertheless,  
the writing process hit a major hiccup very early on. In the introduction to the 
book’s third edition, Sarah and Alan had included the following anecdote:

For technical writers, answering the obligatory “What do you do for a 
living?” question at a party can have many effects. It can: 

—  Create more questions: “What’s that?”
—  Draw blank stares
—   Provoke  some  minor  hostilities:  “Did  you  write  that  worthless 
online help that came with my word processing software?” (Pringle 
& O’Keefe, 2009, p. 19)

As  Sarah,  Alan,  and  I  developed  a  plan  to  revise  and  update  the  book,  we  
realized that we just couldn’t write it. Although we still did some technical writ-
ing  (Sarah  and  Alan  as  consultants,  and  I  in  a  small  portion  of  my  teaching 

Introduction  3

and  research),  we  just  no  longer  identified  as  technical  writers.  The  “What 
do you do for a living?” question hit us hard. We attempted to answer it with 
“professional communicator,” “content strategist,” “content developer,” “content 
specialist,” even “content designer”—until we noticed that the term “content” 
was unavoidable in any of our most accurate answers, which eventually led to 
“content operations specialist.” In the very broad terms that we drafted during 
the conference’s lunch breaks, Sarah and I saw the role of the content operations 
specialist as a coordinator of the processes (manual and automated) to imple-
ment a strategy for developing, deploying, and delivering user-facing content 
in an organization. 

Around that time, Patrick Bosek—who, incidentally, also attended that con-
ference in North Carolina—published on LinkedIn a post attempting to define 
Content Operations. Patrick’s early definition of the term is as follows: “Content 
Operations—ContentOps—is the infrastructure that maximizes your content 
creators’ efforts and guards against procedural errors by automating as much of 
the content development process as possible” (Bosek 2020).

Other  industry  colleagues,  including  Rahel  Anne  Bailie—who  had  served 
with me on a committee in the late 2010s—replied to Patrick’s post and pro-
vided  their  own  definitions,  which  gave  me  an  idea  for  the  book  that  I  still 
planned to write with Sarah. What if, instead of an introduction to technical 
writing, we were to write an introduction to ContentOps? What if we brought 
back  the  guest  lecture  model  and  invited  experts  from  industry  to  provide 
chapters  that  could  guide  discussion  about  this  topic?  Sarah  and  I  invited  
Patrick  and  Rahel  (who  very  kindly  joined  us  in  many  Zoom  calls  at  
9:00 pm—her time—during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic) to join the 
book project. 

That early idea for this book had us writing from the intersection of technical 
communication and ContentOps. However, we noticed that focusing only on 
the ContentOps of technical communication would leave out many important 
conversations and voices from marketing, user experience research, localiza-
tion, and other disciplines that were also talking about ContentOps. As a result, 
we expanded the team and invited more industry experts to contribute their 
“guest lecture” chapters to cover a broad spectrum of professional and enter-
prise content. It helped that around that time, Rahel started hosting a webinar 
series  for  The  Content  Wrangler  network—titled  Let’s  Talk  Content  Ops—
that expanded our list of industry experts. Kevin Nichols came along, and he 
brought Loy Searle. Rahel and Sarah invited Jeff MacIntyre. Rahel suggested 
Kate  Kenyon,  and  I  reached  out  to  Jonathan  McFadden  and  Jason  Swarts—
a kindred-spirit college professor interested in the content professions. Anita 
Walz  and  Peter  Potter,  at  Virginia  Tech  Publishing,  patiently  waited  while  I 
pitched them a different book with a revamped list of contributors every semes-
ter. The generous contributors to this edited collection agreed with our original 
goal of publishing it as an open-access resource.

4  Content Operations from Start to Scale

If you are a practitioner or executive reader and the guest lecture genre does 
not work for you, think of the contributions compiled in this book as expert 
presentations inspired by the Talks at Google series or the toolbox talks with 
specialists at a work site during the lunch break. We aim to provide an intro-
duction to ContentOps, explaining its place in the organization and how we 
can use its principles to deliver better content at scale. This collection of essays 
has the purpose of making ContentOps teachable across silos and departments. 
It  offers  a  convergent  approach  for  industry-based  training  and  college-level 
courses representing an inclusive definition of professional content. We hope 
that  the  chapters  in  this  collection  inform  decision  makers  in  industry  and 
inspire  research  and  teaching  ideas  in  academia.  Above  all,  we  hope  that  it 
minimizes the number of blank stares when the term “Content Operations” or 
“ContentOps” is mentioned in the workplace or the classroom.

But … what is content?
Spoiler alert: Although this book includes a whole chapter titled “Defining 
Content Operations,” the definition that Rahel includes in that chapter—and 
that I included at the beginning of this introduction—is as follows: “Content 
Operations  (ContentOps)  is  the  implementation  of  a  strategy  that  incorpo-
rates  people,  processes,  and  technologies  to  optimize  content  production,  so 
that organizations can leverage their content as business assets while retaining 
content quality.”

Throughout this book, our industry experts share Rahel’s vision for the term. 
We implement the definition of ContentOps as the operationalization of a con-
tent strategy. Another spoiler: Rahel defines content strategy as the formation 
of a plan that codifies a repeatable system that governs the management of con-
tent throughout the entire content life cycle. Then again, she has been using a 
version of that definition since the early 2010s (see, for example, Bailie 2014). 

Later in this introduction, I will take a look at how some other authors and 
organizations are using the term “Content Operations.” Regardless of the spe-
cific meaning that an author gives to ContentOps, we need to start by defining 
what we mean by content.

Some definitions of content are broad. Probably one of the most generous 
definitions  of  the  term  comes  from  Mike  Atherton  and  Carrie  Hane,  who 
see content as “substantive information that is expressed through a medium” 
(2018, p. 33). Other long-standing definitions focus on the needs of consum-
ers of digital communication products. Kristina Halvorson and Melissa Rach, 
for  example,  provide  the  following  definition  in  their  seminal  book  Content 
Strategy for the Web: “Content is what the user came to read, learn, see, or expe-
rience. From a business perspective, the content is the critical information the 
website, application, intranet, or any other delivery vehicle was created to con-
tain or communicate” (Halvorson & Rach, 2012). 

Deane Barker provides a  definition that  focuses on  process  and consump-
tion. According to Barker, content is “information produced through editorial 

Introduction  5

process  and  ultimately  intended  for  human  consumption  via  publication” 
(2016a, p. 5). Writing from a disciplinary platform in marketing, the late James 
Mathewson and his coauthor Mike Moran found their definitions in the eyes 
and fingers of users, describing content as “what users of digital media con-
sume. It’s what they look for when they search for stuff. It’s what they promote 
when they like and share items” (2016, p. 13).

After Rahel read an early draft of this introduction, she commented that she 

uses the following definitions to distinguish terms related to content:

• Copy = editorial; texts: meant for human comprehension
• Metadata = technical; schemas: meant for machine “understanding”
• Content = editorial + technical.

The combination of editorial and technical to create the kind of content that we 
are talking about in this edited collection has strong roots in the discipline of 
technical  communication—particularly  as  it  applies  to  content  management 
practices  and  tools.  In  their  article  “The  Current  State  of  Component  Con-
tent Management: An Integrative Literature Review,” Rebekka Andersen1 and 
Tatiana Batova report on a meticulous exploration of academic and industry 
publications that define the term “content.” Their findings show that content 
“is  used  widely  to  refer  to  the  product-  and  service-related  information  that 
organizations  produce  for  their  customers  and  other  stakeholders”  (2015,  
p.  253).  Andersen  and  Batova  acknowledge  that  content  has  not  been  exten-
sively defined, writing, “the literature tends to focus on definitions of content 
components,  the  stand-alone,  small  units  of  text  used  to  build  information 
products, such as online Help, user manuals, and training materials” (p. 253). 
Some of the definitions they quote include the following from Scott Abel: “Any 
text, image, video, decoration, or user-consumable elements” that help people 
understand “an organization’s products or services, stories, and brand” (2014,  
p.  12).  Abel  expands  that  definition  by  pointing  out  that  content  can  be 
described in the following ways:

• Contextualized data
• The stuff inside a container
• An extension of the user experience
• A business asset (Abel, 2014, p. 12)

Andersen and Batova also highlight a definition from Joe Gollner, who situ-
ates content between data and information in the data-information-knowledge 

1  Rebekka Andersen is my most frequent collaborator in academia. I acknowledge and 
appreciate her behind-the-scenes input into this introduction (and the whole edited 
collection).

hierarchy. Gollner’s definition views content as “potential information,” as the 
“connective  tissue  that  connects  information  transactions  to  data  resources 
and accumulates these transactions into the social construction of grounded 
knowledge  that,  in  turn,  serves  as  the  basis  for  sound  judgment  and  effec-
tive  action”  (Gollner,  2014).  Andersen  and  Batova  started  their  exploration 
from their primary disciplinary identity as technical communicators, but they 
identified a trend that expanded the use of content (and some related terms,  
like “component content management”) “for all product- and service-focused 
content,  including  marketing,  learning,  and  technical  content,  as  well  as  
web content” (2015, p. 254).

From  a  wider  perspective,  grounded  in  writing  studies,  Lisa  Dush  pro-
poses the following definition: “Content is writing—or composed texts—also  
conceived  of  as  digital  assets,  conditional  in  their  shape  and  value,  that  are 
assembled within and pushed out to networks, where human and machine audi-
ences will assess them, assign value to them, consume them, appropriate and  
repurpose  them,  extract  from  them,  and  push  them  into  other  networks. 
Said differently, as a set of characteristics, content is conditional, computable, 
networked,  and  it  is—or  will  be—commodified”  (2015,  p.  178).  That  com-
modification,  Dush  claims,  “always  happens  to  texts  in  circulation”  (p.  178; 
her emphasis). She adds that it “is important to hold this commodification at 
the core of content’s definition, as it encourages healthy suspicion and critical 
examination” (p. 178). 

Quite  a  few  authors  are  more  than  healthily  suspicious  about  the  com-
modification  of  writing-as-content.  Miles  Kimball  has  been  one  of  the  most  
vocal  academics  raising  concerns  about  the  commodification  of  content—
specifically  in  the  field  of  technical  writing.  Kimball  argues  that  document 
production that separates form from content has become the domain of two 
groups:  “one  smallish  group  of  people  paid  well  to  think  strategically  about 
design,  rhetoric,  visualization,  presentation,  information  architecture,  tech-
nology, and usability, and another much larger, less-well-paid group of people 
who write fragmented paragraphs that they save to a database, never knowing 
exactly  where  or  how  they  will  be  used”  (2016,  p.  10).  This  larger  group  of  
writers  contributes  to  the  “content  machine”  that  those  in  more  strategic 
roles have designed. In Kimball’s opinion, “this movement toward separating  
content writing from strategic design makes technical writing of this type look 
less like a profession and more like a modular, relatively mechanical activity—
just like any part of a machine” (p. 9).

The  idea  of  the  content  machine  (which  Sarah  O’Keefe  and  Kate  Kenyon 
address in their chapters included in this volume) is a process-focused meta-
phor for describing ContentOps. Like Alex Masycheff, a content automation 
specialist in industry who has also addressed the commodification of content 
(2018), we believe that focusing on user experience and human—and human-
istic—endpoints is a more comprehensive and (why not?) optimistic approach

to  authoring,  processing,  and  delivering  content.  Focusing  on  human  activi-
ties  allows  us  to  maintain  a  healthy  suspicion  of  abusive  content  practices, 
but it also allows us to prepare professionals to avoid those practices and keep 
humans in the loop. 

It would be helpful to describe the commodification of content as the treat-
ment  of  some  communication  products  as  business  assets.  ContentOps—or 
effective  ContentOps—does  not  aim  to  commodify  all  communications  in 
an  organization.  The  goals,  instead,  should  be  to  perceive  and  treat  valuable 
pieces of content as business assets and to establish and maintain workflows 
that implement a strategy for the automation of routine tasks related to content 
creation and processing.

Furthermore, no one is calling for a commodification of all creative content. 
If one day I finally decide to write the next great Mexican American novel, I 
probably  will  not  write  it  in  “fragmented  paragraphs  that  [I]  save  to  a  data-
base, never knowing exactly where or how they will be used,” unless the novel 
is  about  the  content  machine—which  is  actually  not  a  bad  idea  for  a  novel.  
It is not as if the automation of business content has the purpose of shattering 
the aura2—in the sense intended by the philosopher and cultural critic Walter 
Benjamin—of works of art. Rather, it seeks to make consumable content easier 
and faster to produce and to offer a consistent user experience to its receivers. 
The content machine of automation is already here and is giving us person-
alized experiences, for good or ill. It is up to us to decide whether we let the 
developers  and  algorithms  control  it  or  if  we  want  to  maintain  the  human-
ity of ContentOps professionals as one of its key components. Establishing a 
contrast between working in theory and practice, the chapters included in this 
collection present experiences and recommendations from content profession-
als  representing  technical  documentation,  marketing,  content  strategy,  and 
design, who have influenced and conquered the content machine for good. 

The purpose of this volume is to present an approach to ContentOps that pri-
oritizes people over tools; cares about diversity, equity, and inclusion in authors 
and readers; establishes and updates a governance plan built on ethical con-
siderations and effective user experience research; aligns with organizational 
business  goals  without  ignoring  the  human  beings  involved  in  its  processes; 
implements and revises the appropriate technology tools for responsible auto-
mation and personalization of content; and adapts to the global and local needs 
of diverse audiences.

2  “What, then, is the aura? A strange tissue of space and time: the unique apparition 
of  a  distance,  however  near  it  may  be.  To  follow  with  the  eye—while  resting  on 
a summer afternoon—a mountain range on the horizon or a branch that casts its 
shadow on the beholder is to breathe the aura of those mountains, of that branch” 
(Benjamin, 2008, p. 23).

Who Is Talking about Content Operations?

If defining content was not an easy task, providing a definition of ContentOps  
that  satisfies  all  the  disciplines  and  sectors  that  have  used  the  term  is  even  
more  complicated.  Part  of  the  problem  in  defining  Content  Operations  (or 
ContentOps)  is  that  some  see  this  term  primarily  as  the  operations  of  con-
tent, including content strategy or content design, while other camps use it to 
describe the operationalization of content, which takes place after content has 
been designed or a strategy has been developed.

As I write this, there are not many books that provide a definition of Content  
Operations—although  some  have  been  talking  about  Content  Operations  
for  decades  but  probably  not  using  that  term  (see  Rahel’s  chapter,  “Defining 
Content  Operations,”  in  this  collection).  Colleen  Jones  is  a  pioneer  in  this  
area, and in her book The Content Advantage (Clout 2.0), she argues that “well-
executed  content  operations”  should  be  combined  with  content  vision  and 
strategy to deliver “the right content for the right customer in the right touch-
point at the right time” (Jones, 2019, p. xiii). In that same volume, Jones defines 
Content  Operations  as  follows:  “Content  operations  is  the  behind-the-scenes 
work  of  managing  content  activities  as  effectively  and  efficiently  as  possible. 
Today,  content  operations  often  require  a  mix  of  elements  related  to  people, 
process, and technology” (p. 162).

In  2020,  Toby  Murdock  and  Zoë  Randolph  published  the  book  Mastering  
One  Voice,  which  they  describe  as  “a  marketing  fable  and  field  guide  to  
content operations.” They provide the following definition for Content Opera-
tions: “An internal operating model that moves teams from status to strategy, 
bringing  visibility,  collaboration,  and  confidence  to  content  at  scale”  (2020,  
p.  131).  In  Leading  Content  Design,  Rachel  McConnell  writes  that  Content 
Operations  “refers  to  the  processes  that  enable  consistent  content  design” 
(2022, p. 7). She adds that ContentOps “lays the foundation for effective and 
efficient work, and frees up team members to think more strategically” (2022, 
p. 8). And the Scriptorium team, led by our own Sarah O’Keefe, defines Con-
tentOps as “the engine that drives your content lifecycle” (2022, p. 30). Their 
ContentOps Manifesto—a sister publication of this collection—is a practical, 
concise, and effective introduction to the topic.

Finding definitions of Content Operations is somewhat easier in the blog-
osphere and Twitterverse. Some of the contributors to this volume, as noted 
above,  actually  started  what  became  their  chapters  in  their  personal  or  cor-
porate  blogs.  Outside  the  contributors  to  this  collection,  other  professionals 
frequently writing about Content Operations online include Carrie Hane, who 
has defined the term as follows: “Content operations is the people, processes, 
and  technologies  that  allow  an  organization  to  implement  its  content  strat-
egy to efficiently produce and effectively deliver content” (2019). Hane adds, 
“Interestingly, most of the definitions came from platforms that enable content 

Introduction  9

operations for content marketing groups. Yet content is produced and delivered 
by more than just a marketing team. Like content strategy itself, content opera-
tions  has  to  rise  out  of  the  silo  of  one  group  within  an  organization  to  have 
maximum impact” (2019).

From  a  software  vendor  perspective,  GatherContent—which  advertises  its 
product as a “Content Operations Platform”—frequently tweets about the sub-
ject. In its definition, ContentOps “is the combination of people, process and 
technology that are required to produce, distribute and maintain content in an 
organisation”  (n.d.).  Colleen  Jones  also  participates  actively  in  conversations 
about the term. Her Twitter influence is amplified by the online presences of 
Content Science and ContentWRX.

It is also worth mentioning what probably could be the oldest definition of 
Content Operations. Deane Barker, who has been using the term for more than 
a decade, explained Content Operations in 2016 with the following statement: 
“Content  Operations  (CO)  is  concerned  with  everything  between  Content 
Strategy (CS) and Content Management (CM). Any form of content manipula-
tion and analysis would be managed by a CO process” (Barker, 2016b).

Our Approach

As  the  subtitle  of  this  volume  indicates,  the  chapters  included  here  are  not  
academic essays or research reports. That is intentional, as the purpose of this 
book is to present perspectives from industry experts to inspire more advanced 
conversations and research projects related to ContentOps. Although Rahel has 
taught for a long time in different academic programs, the only full-time aca-
demics in this collection are bookending the essays: I in this introduction, and 
Jason Swarts in the afterword. Yet through the life cycle of this book (including 
its very long design stage with Sarah), we always intended to publish it through 
an academic press to strengthen connections between industry and academia 
and to incite transdisciplinary dialogue.

The  chapters  that  follow  focus  on  essential  considerations  for  ContentOps  
implementation,  regardless  of  scale  or  subject  matter  involved.  First, 
Rahel  defines  the  term  and  performs  a  comprehensive  literature  review  of  
ContentOps  (and  other  related  operational  models—or  “Ops”).  Sarah  then 
focuses on the variables of scalability, velocity, consistency, risk mitigation, and 
compliance for a given content-related project as indicators to use when mak-
ing a business case for ContentOps. Sarah establishes some analogies between 
ContentOps and manufacturing, but Kate Kenyon calls for governance as the 
key  component  to  ensure  that  the  content  machine  delivers  effective  infor-
mation products for human users. Kate presents a set of checks for standards 
to  keep  the  content  machine  efficient  but  also  effective  in  its  processing  and 
 publishing work. 

10  Content Operations from Start to Scale

Rahel and I then address those readers who are actually content developers. 
We provide ideas on how to architect content for operating models that demand 
maximum agility and can scale with ease. Rahel and I introduce a spectrum of 
robustness for ContentOps, in which different levels enable and allow diverse 
features and capabilities. At the highest levels of robustness on that spectrum, 
an  attractive  feature  is  content  personalization.  In  order  to  know  the  users 
of  a  given  ContentOps  and  plan  for  personalization,  a  team  should  conduct 
research on customer experience, and that is what Kevin P. Nichols addresses in 
his chapter, arguing that a solid understanding of the customer journey and its 
stages is necessary to frame its role pertaining to ContentOps. The path to con-
tent personalization, once a team has conducted customer experience research, 
leads to Jeffrey MacIntyre’s chapter in this collection. Jeff presents connected 
experiences as the natural fruit of a strong ContentOps function, which sets up 
an environment of productive authors creating effective content for personal-
ized delivery that addresses specific users’ needs.

Loy  Searle  explores  intersections  of  localization  and  ContentOps,  and  she 
analyzes their shared publishing systems and emphasis on words that impact 
customers and their experiences. Patrick Bosek, acknowledging that Content 
Operations intrinsically relies on systems and tools, gives a platform-agnostic  
overview  of  the  technology  that  supports  effective  ContentOps.  Like  some 
other authors in this collection, Patrick makes a living from specific tools and 
standards, but his recommendations cut across disciplines and silos to deliver 
guidelines that work regardless of specific software implementations.

In  the  epilogue,  Jonathan  McFadden  reminds  us  that  ContentOps  is,  ulti-
mately, about the individuals who consume, use, and interact with the content 
that we create to accomplish tasks, meet goals, and fulfill obligations. Jon writes 
about the many faces and needs of those individuals to connect ContentOps to 
diversity, equity, and inclusion. Lastly, Jason Swarts looks at next steps in the 
afterword. In particular, he looks at the implications of ContentOps for cur-
riculum in technical communication, with one eye on specialized workflows 
and knowledge but another on the basic research in the field that provides the 
foundation for those specialized skills and competencies. 

Who Is This Book For?

When  Sarah  O’Keefe  and  I  started  drafting  this  volume,  at  one  point  we  
envisioned a textbook titled The Content Professional. Our original audiences 
were undergraduate students in technical writing or communication courses 
(and their instructors) who were interested in current trends in content crea-
tion, as well as early-career technical authors or other professionals interested 
in moving to a career in technical content development. 

As the book evolved and incorporated viewpoints from marketing, user expe-
rience,  content  design,  and  tools  development,  among  others,  the  audiences 

Introduction  11

expanded  to  the  following  list  (most  likely  incomplete  and  ambitious  at  the 
same time). First, in academia, we aim to reach primarily undergraduate audi-
ences in programs in communication, technical/professional communication 
and writing, marketing, and computer science, as well as faculty and graduate 
(or advanced undergraduate) students in the fields of technical communica-
tion, computer science, marketing/business information technology, operations 
management,  library  science,  and  any  transdisciplinary  initiatives  related  to  
ContentOps.  We  also  envision  an  academic  audience  of  community  college 
faculty for applied technical communication courses. In industry, we hope to 
reach trainers and content professionals and managers working with techni-
cal or product content, marketing content, and related technologies. Managers 
in technical publications teams, technical writers/communicators, information 
architects, content strategists, content designers, and UX writers will also find 
this  material  worthwhile,  and  we  foresee  an  audience  sector  represented  by 
information technology professionals interested in contrasting ContentOps to 
DevOps or ITOps.

I earnestly hope that this collection answers some questions—and inspires a 
few more—for anyone who is interested in the concept of Content Operations.

Defining Content Operations

Rahel Bailie 

Content Operations may seem like a relatively new addition to the complement 
of fields of practice within the content industry. In fact, Content Operations has 
been around as long as content has been produced as part of an organizational 
process. It wasn’t called Content Operations—or ContentOps, to use the term 
that’s become part of the technology vernacular. Deane Barker, a respected con-
sultant and author of O’Reilly’s Web Content Management book (Barker, 2016), 
has found references to Content Operations in one of his blog posts from over a 
decade ago. Similarly, I have found references to Content Operations in articles 
and presentations that I created in the early 2000s. 

The  difference  between  talking  about  Content  Operations  then  and  now 
seems  to  be  a  change  in  mental  model  over  a  period  of  time.  One  reason  
why  the  understanding  of  ContentOps  is  gaining  traction  could  be  concept 
formation—that  is,  the  process  of  sorting  specific  experiences  into  general 
rules or classes. Because concepts such as DevOps, DesignOps, ResearchOps, 
FinanceOps, AIOps, and so on have become familiar, it’s not much of a men-
tal stretch to consider what ContentOps might mean. Another reason may be 
that the need for operational models has grown along with the size of our con-
tent corpora. When enough organizations feel the pain of trying to manage a 
steadily growing body of content, they start to look for ways to operationalize  
their processes.

Operating Models

“Content is one of the oldest disciplines, yet it has the least mature operational 
controls in today’s enterprise.” This is one of two ideas that I often find myself 
repeating. (The second idea comes at the end of this chapter.) To understand 
ContentOps, we first need to understand what it means to have an operating 
model. Let’s look at some definitions.

One definition, from Wikipedia, starts this way: “An operating model is both 
an abstract and visual representation (model) of how an organization delivers 
value to its customers or beneficiaries as well as how an organization actually 
runs  itself.”1  The  expansion  of  this  definition  is  telling:  the  author  maintains 
that “probably the most common use of the operating model tool is to get align-
ment between managers in different functions or divisions about how they are 
going to work together for the benefit of the whole.” In other words, an operat-
ing model works to define processes, especially across departments (or team, 
squads, or any other euphemism enterprise teams now use), so that the overall 
goals of the organization can be achieved.

According  to  the  Strategy&  group  of  PricewaterhouseCoopers  (PwC),  “An 
operating model determines behavior, workflow and process design, IT deci-
sions, and investment decisions” (n.d.). The authors emphasize that an operat-
ing model must be aligned with an organization’s strategy to be effective. They 
point out that underperforming operating models may be a detriment to the 
overall business in three general ways. The first is hoarded or wasted resources; 
the second is not following through on strategic goals; and the third is a corpo-
rate culture that doesn’t enforce accountability. I will return to this statement 
when looking specifically at the operating models for content.

The title of the EY (Ernst & Young) report Operating Models: Delivering on 
Strategy and Optimizing Processes (Murphy et al., 2016) summarizes its thesis, 
which is that an operating model is a bridge between an organization’s strategy 
and operations. The strategy can be understood as why an organization is mak-
ing  certain  decisions.  An  operating  model  determines  what  an  organization 
should be doing to implement the strategy, and operations provides the how, so 
that the implementation can be carried out with consistency.

Operations as the Outcome of a Strategy

How  do  these  definitions  play  out  in  the  content  world?  Since  Ann  Rock-
ley’s seminal book, Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy, 
was first published (2002), the industry has been focused on content strategy 
as  if  this  concept  had  just  been  invented. The  reality  is  that  since  the  1940s, 

1  Wikipedia, s.v. “Operating model,” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_model,

Defining Content Operations  15

practitioners  from  multiple  professions  have  attempted  to  find  operating  
models for content production. In “An Uneven History of Content Strategy,” 
Don  Day,  one  of  the  pioneers  of  componentized  content,  comments  on  the 
invention of structured markup languages to automate content use and reuse 
(Bailie, 2020).

The irony is that content strategies were often formulated and implemented 
by technical writers as a standard expectation of their jobs. Rather than a pro-
gression from strategy to operating model and then to operationalizing con-
tent processes, the content industry backed its way into articulating strategy. 
In the early days of content strategy, some writers scoffed at what they saw as 
an inflated name for something they did regularly alongside the main job of 
developing content.

Content strategy is the formulation of a plan that codifies a repeatable system 
governing the management of content throughout the entire content life cycle. 
In other words, we create a content strategy to find a way to operationalize con-
tent processes. The content strategy needs to connect to ContentOps, whether 
that’s planning for more efficiency on the marketing or editorial side or design-
ing a technical content ecosystem to increase delivery efficiencies. Oftentimes, 
it’s both; more efficiency requires an upgrade in tooling. In organizations that 
have  squandered  significant  time  and  effort,  ContentOps  is  not  a  luxury.  It’s 
critical for smooth operations and a competitive edge.

Eventually, the recognition that having a content strategy was an important 
step toward meeting business goals with better content processes led to a sepa-
ration  of  the  strategy  phase,  the  implementation  phase,  and  the  operational 
phase. Of course, a content strategy is worthless if an organization puts its care-
fully crafted, elegant strategy into a drawer to gather dust. If there is no imple-
mentation phase, then the strategy remains simply an unimplemented plan. 

Operational Models across Industry

Before looking specifically at Content Operations, it’s worth visiting some of 
the  operational  models  in  the  professions  with  which  content  professionals 
work.  By  comparing  operations  management  models,  we  can  ascertain  how 
their common principles apply to ContentOps.

Some content developers will be familiar with the concept of DevOps, which 
is a software engineering methodology that unifies software development (Dev) 
with  information  technology  operations  (Ops).  According  to  the  Wikipedia  
definition,2 the goal is to shorten systems’ development life cycles while deliver-
ing features, fixes, and updates frequently and in close alignment with business 
objectives. The main characteristic of DevOps is to advocate for automation and

16  Content Operations from Start to Scale

monitoring at all steps of software development, from integration, testing, and 
releasing to deployment and infrastructure management.

DesignOps  might  be  another  familiar  term  to  content  developers  working 
with product designers. The Nielsen Norman Group defines design operations 
as “the orchestration and optimization of people, processes, and craft in order 
to  amplify  design’s  value  and  impact  at  scale”  (Kaplan,  2019).  The  explana-
tion for the need for design operations is to address challenges such as helping 
design teams grow and evolve, finding and hiring people with the right skills, 
creating efficient workflows, and improving the quality and impact of design 
outputs. Similarly, ResearchOps has developed over a period of a few years in 
response to the need for standardized processes around planning, carrying out, 
and  applying  research.  Nielsen  Norman’s  definition  of  research  operations  is 
“the orchestration and optimization of people, processes, and craft in order to 
amplify the value and impact of research at scale” (Kaplan, 2020).

In  2014,  DocOps  made  its  appearance,  aimed  specifically  to  support  tech-
nical  communication  in  producing  product  content  (see  Johnson,  2014).  Its 
goal makes sense, as the function of technical communication often involves 
managing massive amounts of content with astounding amounts of complexity. 
Technical communicators have taken on ContentOps out of sheer necessity. In 
fact, this discipline has been around since the 1990s, reflecting a super-efficient 
processing of technical documentation. DocOps has evolved to accommodate 
demands such as multiproduct, multichannel product content.

One  of  the  most  pertinent  definitions  of  an  operational  model  is  that  of  
DataOps.  Wikipedia  describes  DataOps3  as  an  automated,  process-oriented 
methodology,  used  by  analytic  and  data  teams,  to  improve  the  quality  and 
reduce the cycle time of data analytics. It incorporates the Agile methodology 
to shorten the cycle time of analytics development in alignment with business 
goals. Importantly, “DataOps is not tied to a particular technology, architec-
ture, tool, language, or framework.” Tools that support DataOps promote col-
laboration, orchestration, quality, security, access, and ease of use.

Commonalities of Operating Models

Comparing operating models across the industry reveals a certain number of 
recurring themes. At a strategic level, the recurring themes could be expressed 
as a culmination of these goals:

• Activate strategy to drive value. Operating models need to be planned, and 
planning points to strategy. All planning gets measured against the organi-
zation’s strategic vision for what it wants to accomplish.

3  Wikipedia, s.v. “DataOps,” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataOps, retrieved September  

13, 2021.

 
Defining Content Operations  17

• Improve  collaboration  across  value  streams.  Essentially,  collaborating 
across value streams takes systems thinking—a way of looking at the big 
picture so that the most overall value can be delivered. It also prevents une-
ven production across the organization, such as code being produced faster 
than it can be tested.

• Automate  continuous  delivery  pipelines.  A  continuous  delivery  pipeline  
is  a  foundational  principle  of  the  Agile  operating  model.  Delivering  in 
sprints allows for a product to be developed over time, with small, regular 
contributions rather than a long development cycle with a single big deliv-
ery at the end. In regulated environments, there may be a final consumer-
facing deliverable; internally, sprints allow each piece of the final deliverable 
to be produced and tested before delivery.

• Enable delivery of information. Efficient operations mean efficient delivery 
of information, whether that is content delivery, data sharing, or a combi-
nation of both. An information bottleneck hobbles a company’s ability to 
operate. Production of information is seen as a value stream, which needs 
to be part of the same continuous delivery pipeline as the other streams.
• Manage  risk.  Risk  management  is  an  important  aspect  of  compliance  in 
industries  where  regulation  is  mandated.  Risk  management  is  becoming 
important in other industries as well, where reputational damage can easily 
become an expensive proposition.

• Improve  innovation.  Continual  improvement  of  the  operating  model 
requires an organization to be innovative in its production methods. Stand-
ing still while competitors find ways to outperform an organization becomes 
a form of stagnation.

Turning these strategic themes into actionable aspects of an operating model 

looks quite tactical. Broadly speaking, the operational objectives are these:

• Reduce  inefficiencies.  Inefficiencies  can  be  found  by  doing  value  stream 
mapping, which ensures that as much waste4 as possible is removed from 
the production process.

• Automate wherever possible. Removing manual steps from a process, even 
if the steps only add a minute or five, adds up, especially when those steps 
could be handled in a microsecond by a computer.

• Develop repeatable processes. Clarity around who does what, and when, in 
a process and who is responsible for each step along the way allows people 
to proceed with confidence.

• Allow scaling up of outputs. Whatever systems are in place—people, pro-

cess, and tooling—should support exponential scale.

delays,  duplication,  unnecessary  motion,  unclear  communication,  inventory,  errors 
that affect customer satisfaction, and lost opportunities.

• Ensure resource availability. This is a key aspect in supporting the strategy 
and the operating model: planning for sufficient resources to be available to 
keep the overall system running smoothly. 

• Monitor results and create insights. Continual monitoring of the health of 
the system to maintain an equilibrium of production efficiency is as impor-
tant as monitoring the health of the product to gather insights and make 
improvements to it.

What  is  important  to  note  here  is  that  the  emphasis  is  on  efficiency  and 
scale, not on quality. In fact, quality itself is not specifically called out as part 
of an operating model. If an operating model is not implemented well, there 
is a risk that it will simply accelerate poor output. However, if the operating 
model stays true to implementing the strategy, then the assumption is that 
the operations will accommodate and enable quality output from the imple-
mented processes.

Case Study of Operational Model Improvements

A  good  way  to  demonstrate  differences  in  operating  models  is  to  show  how 
accounting changed over time. Let’s start by looking at how transactions were 
traditionally recorded and how they are recorded now.

Since 1494, double-entry bookkeeping dictated the way in which accounting 
transactions were made. A T-account (whose name derived from the T-shape 
of the ledger) had at least two entries for each transaction, and often more than 
two entries, as shown in Figure 1.1. At the end of the month, a trial balance was 
created to check that all the entries were correct. Anywhere from a day to an 
entire week would be devoted to checking entries and correcting errors. The 
head bookkeeper or accounting manager would generate some sort of financial 
statement that would indicate the company’s financial position.

This operating model was manual, labor-intensive, and prone to error. Scal-
ing company activity meant adding more accounting clerks (as in Figure 1.2), 
whose work could be measured in the number of transactions to be recorded. 
This operating model continued for some 500 years, until accounting systems 
started to be computerized in the 1950s.

Today’s operating model incorporates much greater efficiency. The process 
uses far fewer people to complete far more transactions. Instead of recording a 
transaction in multiple places, which then need to be cross-referenced and ver-
ified at the end of the month, accounting clerks enter transactions once and let 
the system handle the rest—if they need to enter each transaction at all. (Many 
transactions are now transfers of data between systems.) The combination of 
streamlining, automation, real-time insights, and the number of transactions 
that can be processed allows companies to scale their capacity efficiently and 
effectively.

If only organizations valued content assets the same way they value finan-
cial  assets!  Despite  Bill  Gates’s  adage  that  “content  is  king,”  most  companies 
treat content like Cinderella before she went to the ball. This collection, Con-
tent Operations from Start to Scale, aims to elevate content from sweeping the 
hearth to being part of the royal court.

Operational Models in Content Production

The type of efficiency and scalability seen in the accounting field has been slow 
to gain momentum in the content field. Practitioners often aren’t aware that there 
are more efficient ways to produce content, so they are not in a position to advo-
cate for a better operating model. Key stakeholders, such as product owners, are 
generally unaware of what happens during content production, and they frankly 
don’t care as long as content gets into the delivery platform. The technology to 
support ContentOps has largely not caught up to the level of sophistication seen 
in other industries. There are pockets of incredible sophistication dominated by 

20  Content Operations from Start to Scale

a handful of technology systems. The vast majority of content production, how-
ever, has not moved beyond the word processing era of the 1990s. Producers use 
tools and processes that are meant for casual business, but they are not fit for 
purpose for the level of complexity now demanded of content production.

Given the framework for operating models across industry, particularly in 
fields that work with content developers, we can apply the principles to operat-
ing models for content. A number of definitions for Content Operations have 
sprung up (see Mills, 2018), with a few key commonalities:

• The focus is on production processes. Whether ContentOps is called a pipe-
line, supply chain, or life cycle, the focus is on the mechanics that allow for 
optimum  efficiency.  This,  in  turn,  allows  content  to  meet  business  goals, 
such as reducing time to market, risk management, ability to personalize, 
manage multiple languages, and produce at scale.

• An operational model for content relies on having a good content strategy—
it’s imperative to know the end goal to be able to implement the appropriate 
operating model to help an organization reach the goal. Cookie-cutter solu-
tions only work for cookie-cutter companies.

• A balanced approach, with a focus on people, processes, and technologies, 
is needed to ensure successful implementation of an operating model for 
content. These three factors are often inseparable.

Definition of Content Operations

The definition of Content Operations will surely change over time. At the time  
of  publication,  the starting point for a definition that is both tool- and genre-
agnostic  can  be  stated  as  follows:  “Content  Operations  (ContentOps)  is  the 
implementation of a strategy that incorporates people, processes, and technolo-
gies to optimize content production, so that organizations can leverage their con-
tent as business assets while retaining content quality.” This basic definition could 
be embellished with specific outcomes, such as the ability to deliver personalized 
content at scale, but that would dilute the essence. The list would get very long  
and never include all of the possible combinations of strategies, production meth-
ods, or business goals. (As an aside, a manifesto from Scriptorium [2022] lays out 
four basic principles of Content Operations, but the manifesto is an important 
supplement to the definition, not part of the definition itself.)

Operational Models for Kinetic Content

In reality, most content genres lend themselves to operationalization. How they 
get operationalized may be quite different, but the drive for efficiency during 
production  through  to  delivery  has  propelled  the  development  of  solutions. 

Defining Content Operations  21

Table 1.1 shows a few examples of how content within an organization can be 
produced and delivered more efficiently.

What these kinds of content have in common can be described as kinesis.  
The content is not published as the end of a supply chain, as happens in print. The  
content  moves  during  the  creation  process  as  it  is  combined,  building-block 
style, or gets used and reused to form other “shapes” of building blocks. The  
content  moves  again  during  the  build  process,  as  content  references  get 
resolved and multiple outputs are generated. The content moves again during 
presentation,  with  different  variants  being  served  up  during  personalization, 
omnichannel delivery, and so on.

22  Content Operations from Start to Scale

Any kinetic content needs to be created, built, and delivered in more sophis-
ticated ways than any simple supply chain can handle. Part of the equation is 
the need for reliability in how other systems can automate the retrieval, aggre-
gation, and delivery of content. For that to happen, the systems need to have 
a  strong  indication  of  what  to  pick  up,  when  to  get  it,  and  where  to  send  it. 
The other part of the equation, then, is getting that reliability: content develop-
ers need to create content in more sophisticated ways, paying attention to the  
editorial  and  metadata  aspects  from  the  very  beginning.  And  that  equation 
rests  on  a  foundation  of  technologies  that  support  the  content  creation  and 
manipulation process (ContentOps) before getting to automation.

Summarizing the Benefits

The commonalities that we see in the content space can act as scaffolding on 
which  we  can  build  an  appropriate  operating  model.  To  understand  how  to 
build a model, we can extend the commonalities to content production.

The  common  ways  in  which  management  frames  strategic  benefits  can  be 

summarized as follows:

• Activate strategy to drive value. Consider the assembly lines of automobile 
manufacturers or the production floor of a major bakery. Their value comes 
from solid planning to get the most from their investment. The sophistica-
tion didn’t happen haphazardly; everything from the level of automation to 
the placement of equipment has been painstakingly implemented against a 
strategy. This is no different than developing a content strategy that deter-
mines the operating model for efficient production.

• Improve collaboration across value streams. This statement assumes that the 
organization recognizes content as a value stream, along with code, data, and 
whatever other streams it considers valuable. Showing an organization’s prod-
uct emptied of content can be a powerful way to demonstrate that content is 
the primary contact with users—and is thus inherently valuable.

• Automate continuous delivery pipelines. When content needs to be deliv-
ered in lockstep with feature development in an Agile environment, there 
is a need to control the management of content throughout the content life 
cycle. There is also a need to reuse content whenever possible to contain 
production time and effort, which is self-evident. The ability to keep con-
tent  flowing  through  the  delivery  pipeline  at  pace  is  a  key  component  of 
keeping the wheels of the production line turning.

• Enable  delivery  of  information.  Salim  Ismail,  lead  author  of  Exponential 
Organizations  (Ismail  et  al.,  2014),  contends  that  any  organization  that 
wants  exponential  growth  must  be  able  to  support  scalable  delivery  of 
information. At ExO Works, founded by Ismail to teach executives how to 
grow their organizations and compete in a hyperconnected world, one of 
the cornerstones for growth is enabling information. When asked by Scott 

Defining Content Operations  23

Abel how to go about enabling information at scale, Ismail’s answer was, 
“That’s why you need good content strategists, to figure it out.”

• Manage risk. Any organization that is subject to compliance has a vested 
interest in ensuring that regulators are satisfied that content is being well 
managed. Aside from this obvious need for an operational model to track 
content  provenance  to  ensure  compliance,  organizations  outside  of  regu-
lated industries are seeing the benefits of managing reputational risk. Hav-
ing a tight audit trail with minimal administrative overhead can be a strong 
motivator in the risk management area.

• Improve  innovation.  Management  understands  that  when  competitors 
invest  in  innovation,  standing  still  becomes  the  equivalent  of  stagnation. 
Innovation comes in many forms, from new ways of communicating with 
users, to new delivery platforms, to new ways to manage information (con-
tent and data) to keep pace with technological developments.

It’s all very well to have a strategic vision for improving operational models, 
but it’s also important to be able to articulate the tactical benefits for executing 
on the strategy. 

• Reduce  inefficiencies.  Once  an  organization  has  measured  the  inefficien-
cies, it can calculate the benefits, whether that is time and resources saved 
in content production or other measures related to the overall delivery of 
the product or service.

• Automate  wherever  possible.  “Stop  using  people  as  slow  computers”  is  
the second idea that I alluded to at the beginning of the chapter—one of the 
ideas  I  find  myself  repeating. The  benefits  of  automation  can  range  from  
the  obvious,  such  as  time  savings,  to  ancillary  benefits,  such  as  error  
reduction.

• Develop repeatable systems. The benefit of having a strong governance sys-

tem propagates throughout the organization.

• Allow scaling up of outputs. The benefits of an organization being able to 
add more products, more product lines, more output channels, more mar-
kets, more languages, and more audiences are invaluable.

• Ensure  resource  availability.  Aside  from  the  obvious  financial  benefits, 
knowing that an organization can plan for surges in resource demand pro-
vides peace of mind and the ability to operate with confidence.

• Monitor results and create insights. This facilitates a continuous improve-

ment cycle for content performance.

The Business Case for Content Operations

Sarah O’Keefe

We have an ingrained mental model of writers as introverted hermits, toiling 
away in solitude. Eventually, they produce manuscripts, which are fed into a 
publishing  pipeline  for  editing  and  production.  This  model  might  hold  for 
some fiction writers, but content production looks very different for marketing 
and technical efforts.

Today’s corporate content requires close collaboration across multiple spe-
cialties, style guides, standardized processes, governance, and industrial-grade 
tools. Creating content for a large organization resembles a manufacturing pro-
cess rather than our traditional model of heroic solo writers.

There is an additional complication. Most content is not just written, processed, 
and delivered once; rather, it undergoes edits, updates, and corrections over time. 
Although you may package and deliver information, the process doesn’t end there. 
Content production is a life cycle in which information is constantly evolving.

We can borrow further from manufacturing and think of ContentOps as an 
assembly line, which lets an organization optimize each component of the content 
development process. Just remember that our content process, unlike an actual 
assembly line, can loop back on itself for content updates. The idea of a “content 
factory” is in stark contrast to the image of a solitary writer, and it can provoke 
resistance or outright hostility. Typically, it’s easier for more technical content cre-
ators—technical writers, UX writers, and API documentation writers—to think 
in manufacturing terms than it is for more creative writers in marketing roles.

Executives view ContentOps through a different lens: they demand a business 
justification  for  any  investment.  (For  a  more  detailed  discussion  of  the  busi-
ness drivers, refer to “Summarizing the Benefits” in the “Defining ContentOps” 
chapter included in this collection.) These are the most common justifications:

• Scalability
• Velocity
• Consistency
• Risk management and compliance

Scalability

In most small businesses, content development is inefficient and fragmented. 
As long as the content volumes are relatively low (and all in one language), this 
inefficiency is reasonable.1

However, as a business grows, content demands multiply. In particular, once 
a business starts expanding product lines and globalizing, it faces the following 
content challenges:

• The  problem  of  controlling  content  without  creating  multiple  copies  of 
information  for  related  documents.  (For  instance,  a  company  might  split 
a product into “regular” and “premium” versions. The “premium” product 
has a few additional features, but the overlapping features are the same. For 
this, the organization needs a way to manage the overlapping content with-
out making copies.)

• The challenge of delivering information into multiple channels—web, print, 
email, social media, and so on—with consistent messages and terminology.
• The  challenge  of  sharing  information  across  multiple  content  types— 
product reference, knowledge base, training, marketing, and so on—while 
avoiding duplicate or contradictory information.

• The rising demand for locale-specific content, including new languages and 

potentially new regulatory requirements.

• The need to identify and target specific audiences with certain content.

Thus, a single piece of content might live in multiple product versions, chan-
nels, content types, and languages. At this point, the price of fragmented content 
rises to an unacceptable level. When every piece of content goes to the web first, 

1  Scriptorium uses a guideline of around $250M in revenue for US organizations. That 
is the point at which organizations start to prioritize global operations and therefore 
scalability. The cutoff tends to be lower for European organizations (which prioritize 
localization earlier in their business life cycle). 

 
The Business Case for Content Operations  27

is used in several other delivery channels, and is translated into dozens of lan-
guages, any friction in the content process gets multiplied for each channel and 
each language. Five minutes of manually moving content from point A to point 
B doesn’t sound like much, until you have six channels (30 minutes) and 20 lan-
guages (600 minutes, assuming five minutes per language per channel). Suddenly, 
you’ve spent hours just moving files around. Industry conversations mention that 
technical writers spend nearly half their time on “document maintenance” tasks.
To build out scalable Content Operations, an organization will need to invest 

in the following:

• A centralized repository for content. 
• A reuse strategy to identify and manage reusable components across chan-

nels and content types.

• A conditional strategy to identify and manage variant content (where most 
of the content is reusable, but one small chunk is unique to a specific deliv-
erable or audience).

• An omnichannel delivery pipeline.
• Audience profiling.
• A  global  content  strategy  to  address  locale-specific  content  requirements 

and localization/translation work.

The payoff for this investment is a content pipeline that lets the organization 

maximize the value of each piece of content.

Velocity

Content velocity affects an organization’s ability to speed up time to market, 
and ContentOps provides a way to improve content velocity. A basic content 
life cycle looks like this:

Authoring  >  editing  >  review/approval  >  localization  >  rendering  > 
delivery

In a paper-based life cycle, most advances were confined to physical produc-
tion, such as faster printing presses. But in a digital content life cycle, an organi-
zation can automate and optimize all stages of the content life cycle.

Authoring and Editing

Organizations can speed up authoring either by making content creators more 
efficient or by reducing the amount of content that needs to be created.

28  Content Operations from Start to Scale

To increase efficiency in the work of content creators, you can provide author-
ing  frameworks,  efficient  authoring  tools,  and  authoring  support  (through 
software and processes). For example, an organization might have a tool that 
automatically identifies overly complex sentences and offers recommendations 
to simplify them. Structured content templates can guide authors as they create 
content to ensure that they include all of the needed components in a particu-
lar document. If a magazine article requires a summary at the beginning and 
an author profile at the end, a structured content tool can prompt authors to 
include that information.

A reuse strategy, which makes content more scalable, also reduces the amount 
of content that needs to be written and thereby improves velocity. To increase con-
tent reuse, it’s critical to provide authors with a way to locate existing content and 
identify good candidates for reuse. Authors shift from prioritizing writing new 
content to identifying new ways to mix and match existing content. Most organi-
zations can expect at least 20% reuse in their product content; that number can 
rise to as high as 80% for certain industries (the semiconductor sector is a good 
example) that have huge content volumes and lots of overlap among product lines.
Reuse  also  improves  outcomes  downstream  in  the  content  life  cycle—more 
reuse means less information to edit, review, approve, translate, render, and deliver.
At a bare minimum, editing content by passing around files and using some 
sort of change tracking is a huge velocity win over paper-based comments. To 
increase editing velocity, organizations can augment human editors with soft-
ware for structure and terminology. Another approach is to step away from the 
author/editor framework and instead create shared documents for collabora-
tive authoring. If a group of two or three authors work together in a shared file 
(Google Docs is a great example of this), they can create a collaborative docu-
ment instead of each working on their own personal filesets. A truly collabora-
tive writing approach blurs the distinction between authoring and editing.

Maintenance

Once content is published, it needs to be maintained. Typically, that means cor-
recting  any  errors  and  making  updates  as  things  change.  A  solid  ContentOps 
workflow means that you can update a piece of content in a single location and 
have the change flow to every place that uses that information. If content is reused 
via copy and paste, then a single content change needs to be made in multiple 
locations. Those problems multiply across languages and content variants.

Another opportunity in maintenance is to examine how changes and correc-
tions are captured and managed. For example, how are user comments handled? 
Are they ignored, or is there a process to capture them, validate the information, 
and then ensure that the underlying content is updated? After the correction is 
made and published, what should happen to the comment?

The Business Case for Content Operations  29

Review and Approval

The review and approval process is a common cause of friction in the content 
life  cycle. The  problem  often  lies  with  limited  authority.  If  a  single  person  is 
responsible  for  approving  content,  that  person’s  availability  determines  how 
quickly content moves through the approval process.

The single point of failure problem can be addressed by increasing the num-
ber of people who have approval authority or by identifying a backup approver 
when the primary approver isn’t available. Once an organization has clarified 
the approval assignments, it should consider a review and approval workflow, 
which may live inside its content management system. This software lets the 
company set up assignments and notifications, so that when an author com-
pletes  a  piece  of  content,  the  content  is  automatically  routed  to  reviewers. 
Reviews could be serial (reviewer A, then reviewer B, then approver C) or par-
allel (reviewers A, B, and C all review at the same time, and when their issues 
are resolved, the content moves into an approved state).

Review and approval workflows vary widely across industries and organiza-
tions. In some places, authors approve and publish their own content. In other 
organizations, extensive review cycles are the norm. Regulated industries typi-
cally  have  compliance  requirements  that  drive  their  review  process.  Review 
stakeholders may also include legal teams or quality assurance.

Rendering

Velocity in rendering requires formatting automation. Content is stored with 
tags or labels that indicate meaning (like “heading 1,” “button label,” or “warn-
ing”),  and  then  the  appropriate  formatting  is  applied  as  the  information  is 
rendered for PDF, HTML, or other formats. A multichannel delivery pipeline 
requires the organization to think about rendering across many channels and 
ensure that the content has all of the labels needed to create every format.

For  maximum  velocity,  a  content  team  needs  to  ensure  that  all  rendering 
is automated. Furthermore, it should build in localization support for all tar-
get  languages.  Manual  formatting  is  doable  in  small  ContentOps,  but  it  will 
become a problem as the organization scales.

Delivery

Delivery is perhaps the phase that has been most transformed by the shift from 
paper  to  digital  workflows.  Although  modern  ContentOps  workflows  have 
added  new  tools  and  technologies  everywhere,  authoring  and  editing  is  still 
recognizably the same process on paper as in a digital workflow. But delivering 

30  Content Operations from Start to Scale

paper documents requires manufacturing (to create physical books) and logis-
tics for actual physical delivery, as opposed to putting content on a website to 
make it available worldwide in a split second.

So even without formal ContentOps, digital delivery is faster than physical 
delivery. The content team does end up with complications because the number 
of channels that they need to deliver to has increased. ContentOps for deliv-
ery  requires  thinking  carefully  about  content  governance—how  soon  after 
approval should content be posted? Is there a delivery schedule? Do you use 
content delivery networks or other intermediaries to manage the load?

Another way to look at delivery is to use a  pull rather than a  push model. 
Instead of finalizing content and then pushing it to publication channels, an 
organization can have content clients. The content client requests information 
from the organization’s content repository (or an intermediate layer) and ren-
ders the content that’s delivered to the client. 

Digital delivery should be instantaneous in any digital workflow, so once a 

team gets to this point, it doesn’t have to worry too much about velocity. 

Consistency

Improving consistency of content provides another justification for investing 
in ContentOps. The technology and processes in a mature Content Operations 
environment make it easier to achieve the following:

• Control terminology across all languages.
• Ensure that the look and feel of content matches; for example, if the rule is 
to italicize glossary terms in technical content, then all glossary terms are 
italicized throughout the content set.

• Ensure that content used in multiple places is the same throughout the corpus.

Content consistency helps build user trust and makes it easier for users to 
understand information. In high-stakes content, such as that related to medical 
devices  or  industrial  equipment,  content  consistency  helps  ensure  the  safety 
of  the  people  using  the  products.  Ensuring  that  all  warnings  are  highlighted 
consistently and follow industry standards helps people avoid injuries due to 
incorrect product use. (It may also reduce the manufacturer’s legal liability if an 
injury does unfortunately occur.)

In addition to safety issues, consistency helps with brand identity and cus-

tomer trust in the following areas:

• The  use  of  consistent  terminology  across  all  channels  and  content  types 
makes the customer feel more comfortable. Customers build confidence as 
they learn an organization’s terminology, instead of stumbling when multi-
ple terms are used for the same concept.

• A  consistent  look  and  feel  assures  the  customer  that  the  content  is  
trustworthy.  When  clients  notice  design  variances,  they  may  wonder  
why they occurred. Does inconsistent design mean that the content is not 
fully vetted?

• Consistent voice and tone help support the brand identity and messaging.
• Consistent  design  patterns  (for  example,  warnings  always  boxed  in  red) 
mean  that  customers  get  familiar  with  a  team’s  design  and  know  how  to 
navigate the content.

• Consistent content writing can be reused across multiple channels and con-

tent types, which reduces the overall cost of ownership for the content.

The business justifications for consistency run the gamut from “stay in com-
pliance with regulators” to “build trust in our brand.” Each organization will 
value consistency based on different considerations.

Risk Management and Compliance

I’ve mentioned risk management and compliance as a factor in several of the 
other business justifications, but I think it’s worth addressing separately. If an 
organization has compliance requirements, ContentOps can formalize the con-
tent life cycle and reduce the risk of compliance errors.

Providing the wrong content or omitting a required content component in a 
regulated environment can lead to delays in product approvals, fines, or worse. 
Establishing rigorous ContentOps that prevent these errors is well worth the 
cost because the risk is so high. Even without compliance requirements, better 
ContentOps is a risk-mitigation strategy. If an organization has good control 
over  its  content,  consistent  formatting,  and  appropriate  reuse,  it  reduces  the 
risk of content errors. 

Publishing  content  introduces  some  risk  for  any  organization,  but  it  is  
especially  important  for  regulated  organizations  to  get  their  content  right.  
For example:

• Submitting incorrect information to a governmental body could result in 

sanctions.

• Having  policies  and  procedures  that  do  not  accurately  reflect  how  a  
medical  device  manufacturer  operates  could  result  in  the  factory  being  
shut down.

• Incorrect  operational  instructions  could  result  in  product  users  being 

injured or killed.

Risk  mitigation  is  more  important  in  some  industries  (like  industrial  equip-
ment) than others (such as video games), so each content team should consider 
the risk profile for its products.

Building Your Business Case

A scrappy startup with a couple hundred pages of content in three languages 
needs a different solution than a global medical device manufacturer, and the 
investment should be commensurate with the expected returns. So as you build 
out ContentOps, assess your organization’s requirements for scalability, velo-
city, consistency, risk mitigation, and compliance—and build accordingly.

Governance for Content Operations

Kate Kenyon

Digital governance is a framework for establishing accountability, roles, 
and decision-making authority for an organization’s digital presence—
which means its websites, mobile sites, social channels, and any other 
Internet and Web-enabled products and services.

—Welchman, 2015, p. 11

When you think about Content Operations, your mind probably doesn’t jump 
immediately to governance. You’re much more likely to think about process, 
or even the outcomes of ContentOps: making things go more smoothly, more 
efficiently, or even just faster. 

But as Rahel Bailie noted in her chapter in this collection, operations has an 
“emphasis … on efficiency and scale, not on quality. In fact, quality itself is not 
specifically called out as part of an operating model. If an operating model is 
not implemented well, there is a risk that it will simply accelerate poor output.” 
So  how  does  a  content  professional  stop  the  machine  from  turning  out  bad 
content—only faster? 

The Role of Governance in Content Operations

I  would  argue  that  part  of  a  ContentOps  model  being  “implemented  well”  
is  having  enough  governance  to  know  that  what  an  organization  is  putting

out  meets  the  organization’s  definition  of  successful  content.  Governance 
underpins  an  Ops  model:  it  decides  the  rules  and  standards  for  the  content. 
Operating models are how an organization implements those rules and checks 
that those standards are being followed. 

Everyone in a company has a mental model of what good content looks like 
and how it behaves. In regulated industries, such as banking and pharmaceuti-
cals, there are also external codes and models of how content should behave—
coupled with large, painful fines for breaching these standards. 

Without clear governance and standards, there’s no strong consensus on what 
that “good content” is, and as time goes on, this leads to expectation gaps between 
what is expected vs. what is being delivered. An expectation gap sounds like “I 
just thought it would be easier to do” or “I thought it wouldn’t take this long,” or 
even “we followed the process right, but I just don’t think it’s very good.”

These gaps are enough to upend any operational changes that an organiza-
tion is making. No matter how fast you can get the machine to run, people will 
pull the factory brake if they don’t like the end results. 

So: governance as an underpinning for an operations model. Where to start?
I’ve structured this chapter as a set of questions to help you consider your 
organization’s needs. Not all will apply, so skip anything that doesn’t work for 
you. Governance needs change over time, so if you do skip things now, remem-
ber to come back and review!

What Do You Need to Govern? 

This is the starting point: what do you even define as “content”? We all think we 
know, but is there an agreed-on definition across the organization of what con-
tent includes? It may just be “all the words, images and documents associated 
with our products,” or it could be broader than that and include app microcopy, 
customer service content, and social media posts. Consider also content that 
you lease or buy from third parties, such as newsfeeds.

Defining what you mean by “content” is the beginning of deciding the stand-
ards that you will need. As with all parts of governance, it’s not a once-and-
done  thing—if  your  scope  of  content  changes,  you  may  need  to  revisit  your 
standards.

What Does “Good Enough” Look Like?

The  first  thing  here  is  a  little  bit  of  organizational  politics.  Everyone  has  to 
largely agree on what “good enough” looks like, and everyone has to agree that 
this standard is worth working hard to meet. Without those two agreements, 
it’s very difficult to define effective ContentOps and get people to stick to it. The 

Governance for Content Operations  35

organization will soon devolve to just-do-it processes where the person who 
shouts the loudest gets their stuff done by whatever means necessary.

Industries with significant fines/regulations for misleading content (e.g., phar-
maceuticals, banking) often have a head start in these areas because the standards 
are usually compulsory, and the costs of not meeting them are punitive. But even 
outside these industries, there are standards that companies can agree to for con-
tent: accessible content, accurate content, portable content, timely content, and 
content in the right languages, for starters, and that’s before an organization gets 
to the fine details of brand voice, tone, and suitable imagery.

To give you a rough yardstick: within banking, I would consider the follow-

ing inputs into content to be “good enough.”

1.  Meeting federal banking and financial regulations.
2.  Meeting internal standards for risk, legality, and fraud.
3.  Meeting audit and compliance standards.
4.  Meeting Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
5.  Allowing open banking interoperability.
6.  Establishing a consistent brand voice and tone.

These standards should be clearly mapped to existing examples and docu-
mentation; having content that is “on brand,” for example, is not enough. The 
implementation of standards should go further and adhere to the organization’s 
brand book and guidelines. If you don’t have that level of specificity, you will 
struggle to make the rules clear enough to follow.

Who Gets to Decide Your Content Definitions and Standards?

This question will inevitably pop up as an organization starts defining its con-
tent standards, so it’s worth tackling it early. Everyone has an opinion, but whose 
do you need to set a standard? Does everyone get a say? I would suggest that 
not everyone gets a say. Whoever is involved should have skills and expertise 
to offer in defining the content standard; they should not be consulted simply 
because they’re senior and would like their opinions included. The standards 
will certainly need senior stakeholder support, but that is not a necessary step.
Content has functionality—it should do something. Some content is very valu-
able to your business, and some less so. Every time you publish something that 
you know isn’t very good (but someone insisted on its being there), you are dilut-
ing the chances of your customers finding the valuable content. My recommen-
dation  is  to  start  by  setting  a  standard  around  what  gets  created,  so  you  only 
have to manage content that is worth having. Choose people who know what 
“good” looks like and who know what is possible within the organization right 
now. Standards should be achievable outcomes, not aspirational daydreams.

How Much Governance Do You Need to Make Your Standards 
Stick? And Where Do You Apply It?

Once you have a scope of content, a definition of “good enough,” and the right 
people to govern it, you get to the thorny part—what processes and tools are 
you going to use to make sure that these standards are met?

This  is  where  theory  meets  practice.  We  all  mean  to  be  good  people  who 
do the right thing. And yet, if time is short and people are tired, overworked, 
underskilled, or just don’t see the point, then standards will be the first thing to 
go. So where do you apply the most scrutiny to your content? At the beginning 
of  the  process,  in  pre-production?  During  production?  Or  post-production, 
once it’s live and visible to customers? 

It’s likely to be a mix of all three, but it’s not likely to be an equal split. The 
areas where your content needs most governance will depend on the role that 
content plays in your organization’s commercial success, the volume and veloc-
ity of content production, and what happens if the content isn’t right.

For example, the content governance needs for a fast-fashion e-commerce  
clothing  company  will  be  very  different  from  those  of  a  bank  offering  
financial  insights  about  asset  and  wealth  management.  Accurate  imagery 
for  clothing  is  key  to  sales  and  is  also  relatively  easy  to  govern  and  check 
during  production.  Conversely,  images  have  limited  impact  on  the  success 
of the bank’s content, but if the wording isn’t accurate, there are significant 
legal risks—so let’s get that content approved by the right people well before  
production begins.

Some examples of governance standards within processes at each point are 

as follows.

• Pre-production
 ° Suitability:  do  you  even  need  this  content?  To  determine  that,  consider 
that all content should have the following:
  A clear purpose
  An outcome for the business and the customer (and no, “awareness” isn’t 
an outcome)
  An end date
  A proven need to exist
 ° Ownership: who is going to own this content throughout its life cycle? Is it 
the person who commissions the content, or the person/team that delivers 
it? Without a clear view of who will be responsible, this task tends to fall 
to the “last person (or team) who touched it,” and that’s rarely the person 
who actually commissioned the content in the first place.
 ° Review date: how long is this content for? Content is rarely as evergreen 
as we think. It needs an agreed-on shelf life, with regular review cycles to 
sniff it for freshness, relevance, and accuracy.

Governance for Content Operations  37

In my practice, I have found content eight years out of date on banking web-
sites. I have found terms and conditions with vital links that no longer work, 
possibly invalidating the terms themselves. This is what happens without con-
tent ownership, accountability, and management—which stems from a lack of 
pre-production governance. 

My personal governance preference is to make those who commission any 
content the owners of that content, responsible for final say about when it goes 
into production and responsible for monitoring it once it’s live. They are also 
the “owners” and will be asked to review that content every week, month, or 
year to ensure that it’s still fit for purpose.

This approach creates a clear matrix of responsibility between those commis-

sioning content and those creating, building, and maintaining it.

• Production
 ° Consider your creation workflows: what’s the standard for your content? 
If  you  have  already  met  the  pre-production  standards  of  knowing  why 
you’re making this content and who it’s for, the briefing process should be 
pretty clear. Woolly briefs reflect woolly thinking, so if you’re seeing this at 
the point of production, it’s a good sign that standards aren’t being defined 
or met earlier on.
 ° Approvals: during production, your ContentOps workflow needs regular 
checkpoints, and each checkpoint needs a clear governance remit. What’s 
being checked, why, and by whom? Table 3.1 gives an example of some 
possible checkpoints.
 ° When setting checkpoints, consider how you will get the content to the 
correct people. Can you give them access to your systems, or is that rather 
risky? Consider how you can set up a shared space to gather and record 
feedback, particularly if you’re working with regulated content.

 ° If  you  need  to  ask  a  lot  of  people  for  feedback  (bad  luck!),  then  
consider the impact of this on your production times. How long can peo-
ple review the material before they need to respond? Is this a person’s sole 
job, or is this a request that you’re making of someone who also has other 
things to do? Set a deadline for people—and be prepared to chase them. 

• Post-production 
 ° Post-production governance is more about quality control than anything 
else. It involves sampling content to see whether it meets specific criteria—
if something is there or not, or whether it is correct or incorrect. As this is 
a rather binary approach, you can consider automating post-production 
checks, and there are a number of products on the market that offer web- 
and document-checking capabilities. These products will check for prob-
lems in the following areas (and others).
  Accessibility:  does  your  web  content  correctly  use  H1  and  H2  titles 
for level-1 and level-2 headings, respectively? Does it meet the WCAG 
guidelines for accessibility?
  Grammar:  is  your  content  grammatically  accurate  (in  all  languages)? 
Does it use a consistent tone and voice? 
  Performance:  are  your  web  pages  loading  quickly  and  accurately?  Are 
you meeting search engine optimization (SEO) standards?
  Metadata:  does  your  content  accurately  and  adequately  use  one  of  the 
many published standards for metadata?
  Images and video quality and sizing: are these correct in your content? 
Do they have alternative text tags and descriptions?

This is a checklist approach to hygiene, but it’s a useful monitor for your pro-
duction standards: if those are slipping, it will show up in these metrics. It’s also 
particularly useful if you have a large volume of content to govern and only a 
few people can make it part of their daily responsibilities.

For  additional  finesse,  I  would  personally  recommend  periodic  audits  
of  existing  content  for  quality,  suitability,  and  tone.  These  audits  are  done  
manually but can give a wider view of the overall body of content rather than 
individual pieces. 

The focus of post-production audits needs to be carefully identified. (What 
are you reviewing? What are you benchmarking against?) But audits can keep 
content  production  values  high.  I  have  done  this  kind  of  audit  over  a  body 
of content (e.g., customer emails) to show where there’s too much variance in 
writing styles. Such differences produce a disjointed customer experience. This 
type of audit is particularly worth doing when an organization has made sig-
nificant changes to its products or its designs. Sometimes content becomes stale 
simply as the company evolves.

Post-production governance should also factor in how and when content is 
released “into the wild.” Treating content like code means that the material will 

Governance for Content Operations  39

be checked thoroughly for errors before it is released—but on the flip side, it 
also means a loss of speed if your release process isn’t super-slick. Relying on 
post-production release mechanisms to catch issues will directly influence how 
your technology stack is configured, so you’ll need a tech partner to help you 
work through these issues in order to understand what will be best for your 
organization.

Do You Need Some Nuance in Your Content Governance?  
Is All Your Content the Same?

In the rush to define a process, differences among types of content are often 
overlooked. How might those differences affect content governance? It’s fine to 
start by saying “these are the rules for our content,” but if it takes three weeks  
to get a tweet signed off (true story!), then you will fairly quickly need to decide 
whether all content should be governed in the same way.

When  looking  at  where  content  governance  needs  to  be  altered,  here  are 

some key areas for consideration.

• Timeliness:  some  content  platforms  move  more  quickly  than  others. 
Social media, in particular, relies on being timely, relevant, and responsive. 
Options for social media governance include managing risks through limit-
ing what subjects can be talked about, having a quicker approvals process, 
or having a much lighter governance policy that accepts potential risks in 
favor of the brand value that comes with responsiveness.

• Urgency: having a governance plan in place for how to publish content in 
emergencies, such as natural disasters, major company issues, and the like, 
is  really  important,  even  if  you  never  have  to  invoke  it.  Know  who  your 
people are for rapid communication, and make sure they know that they 
need to respond quickly.

• Risk: this could be financial, regulatory, or reputational risk. Some content 
is  particularly  contentious.  One  way  of  viewing  content  governance  as  it 
relates to risk is through the lens of “how badly could this go?” Perhaps you 
can apply less stringent review processes to low-risk content. Organizations 
will often have to feel their way along as content governance develops. At 
first it all feels risky, but as people become more fluent and familiar with 
standards, spaces for change will open up.

Global vs Local: Do Your Standards Apply Everywhere? 

This question will come up even if your content is only in one language! As 
language reflects the culture and expectations of the people who speak it, what 

40  Content Operations from Start to Scale

is “good enough” in one region or country may not cut it elsewhere, even if the 
words are readily understood. Voice and tone guides need to be reviewed to see 
whether they will scale to meet the expectations of a new audience. Legal and 
operational differences may mean that content is not even suitable for reuse but 
must be reimagined for a different region or country. Even emojis need consid-
eration—an innocuous thumbs-up, for example, is seen as offensive by many in 
Greece and in Middle Eastern countries (Rawlings, 2018).

If you intend to share and reuse a lot of content across multiple countries, you 
may need to review the balance of your overall governance model entirely. Unless 
everyone  is  polylingual,  centralized  governance  across  multiple  countries  can 
involve content being translated (or back-translated) in order to be reviewed.

If a centralized model of governance becomes too cumbersome and nobody 
can get content out in a timely fashion, it’s time to rethink. In these cases, a 
federated  model  of  governance  is  often  more  effective.  The  federated  model 
involves a central team for policy and standards; local teams, with local knowl-
edge,  are  empowered  to  decide  how  policy  and  standards  are  implemented. 
This model requires trust and collaboration but is generally more effective in 
business. I’ve seen it used in large marketing departments of corporations as 
well as within product design systems.

What’s Your Plan for the Governance Life Cycle? 

As I mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, governance is an ongoing 
process rather than one-and-done. If governance is to stick and be adhered to, 
it will take more than an initial enthusiasm for “good content” to make that 
happen. Successful application of governance standards requires those stand-
ards to be baked into the processes of content creation and the technology that 
supports them. And to keep your organization honest, you will also need to 
consider how to monitor whether your agreed-on standards are being met. 

The threat of external review and censure ensures that those organizations in 
regulated industries recognize the need to self-police. But if your company is 
not externally regulated, who and what could you use to monitor governance 
adherence? The most common answer is a periodic audit of governance that 
looks at a sample of n pieces of content to see whether the agreed-on standards 
were followed—and if not, why not. 

These periodic audits are often sprung upon teams to avoid the temptation 
to cover up problems, but checking for governance adherence should not be 
used to punish those who don’t follow the rules. Instead, introduce audits as 
a temperature check that will tell the organization whether the governance is 
healthy or needs an update.

Another approach to governance review is to schedule it (every three or six 
months works well in most companies) and then to encourage people to bring 

Governance for Content Operations  41

their  process  complaints  to  be  aired,  reviewed,  and  incorporated  into  newer 
standards. I have seen this approach succeed, but only when individuals have 
a certain degree of trust in their companies and feel that they have the ability 
to speak up. If proposing new governance is seen as “rocking the boat,” or if 
governance is understood as set in stone, this approach won’t uncover issues 
that need to be addressed.1

What’s Your Plan if Things Go Wrong?

Not to end this chapter on a down note, but part of governance involves plan-
ning for when governance fails. It’s planning for when confidential content ends 
up being shared publicly, when a disgruntled employee leaks documents, when 
content  is  published  too  early  or  too  late,  when  it  accidentally  breaks  copy-
right, or when it unintentionally causes offense. You can look to newspapers 
and social media for examples of your competition experiencing such failures!
Running disaster exercises will allow you to plan, somewhat, for resilience in 
times of crisis. Be sure that you have a map and processes for what should hap-
pen if something goes wrong with your content. Who gets notified? How? And 
how long will you give the organization to fix the problem? 

A Conclusion

Within all ContentOps models (or operating models for content production), 
the inevitable question that comes up from stakeholders is “yes, but how long 
until I can see my stuff live?” Content governance sets the standards that help 
technologists  and  strategists  answer  that  question.  Knowing  what  is  “good 
enough,” and how and where that standard will be applied, provides the basis 
for getting your business that magical service-level agreement. 

Without  content  governance,  ContentOps  becomes  purely  about  process 
speed and efficiency, and it disregards quality. If a company decides to pare back 
process without reference to standards, it will inevitably get back into a position 
where gaps arise in expectationsfor content. Ensure that your content standards 
are defined, realistic, regularly reviewed, well documented, supported through 
technology, and seen within your organization as worth delivering. The stand-
ards will provide the why for much of your ContentOps as well as the definition 
of  success  for  your  content.  “Done”  is  not  the  finish  line  for  content—“good 
enough” is the mark to aim for. 

1  A third approach could be to use automated content optimization software, which 
Sarah  O’Keefe  mentions  in  her  chapter,  “The  Business  Case  for  Content  Opera-
tions,” in this collection.

Operationalizing Content Creation

Rahel Bailie and Carlos Evia

In this volume, we have now defined Content Operations, established the con-
text  for  effective  ContentOps,  introduced  the  business  benefits  that  can  be 
realized by having the right operating model, and discussed the importance of 
the governance aspects of content-related projects. By now, you are probably 
wondering about the actual content development—from writing to tagging to 
managing and eventually delivering content.

This chapter addresses the actual creation of content. However, it is not a detailed 
guide on how to write or develop content. Instead, it provides guidance on how 
to architect content for operating models that demand increasing levels of agility 
in exchange for the ability to scale with ease. We refer to this specific combination 
of demand and exchange as the level of robustness of a content practice. As a con-
cept, robustness can mean different things depending on the discipline or context 
in which it is being mentioned. For example, in structural engineering, robustness 
is a desirable property in structures and systems. It implies “tolerance to damage 
from extreme loads or accidental loads,” but it is also “applicable to other adverse 
effects  such  as  sensitivity  to  human  error  and  deterioration”  (Baker  et  al.,  2008,  
p. 253). Other descriptions of robustness present it as “a design principle of natural, 
engineering, or social systems that have been designed or selected for stability”—a 
definition attributed to the Santa Fe Institute (Baker et al., 2008, p. 254)—and “the 
ability of a system to continue to operate correctly across a wide range of opera-
tional conditions, and to fail gracefully outside of that range” (Gribble, 2001, p. 21).

44  Content Operations from Start to Scale

In the context of ContentOps, robustness inherits components of all of these 
definitions: a robust content workflow needs to be tolerant of adverse effects, 
stable, and able to operate across a wide range of conditions or degrade (fail) 
gracefully. 

We are aware that not all ContentOps require the same benefits and affor-
dances, and in this chapter we introduce several considerations based on the 
level of robustness set for a specific content-related project. These considera-
tions can be summarized as the degree to which content production facilitates 
ContentOps (which we describe as the level of kinesis for a piece of content), 
the adoption and implementation of editorial conventions and technical stand-
ards  to  produce  intelligent  content,  and  the  establishment  of  a  ContentOps 
North Star: delivering content as a service (instead of publishing as a deliver-
able or set of deliverables).

Producing Content to Facilitate Content Operations

For content to be able to work within an operating model that has any level 
of robustness (or any degree of complexity), the way the content is produced 
and  managed  needs  to  be  carefully  planned  and  executed.  Content  needs  to 
be kinetic—to move from state to state along the content supply chain. Con-
tent may exist across multiple repositories, with multiple variants, in multiple  
languages, and end up in multiple outputs, in multiple formats or media. Even 
formerly  simple  operating  models—e.g.,  publishing  blog  posts—can  now 
involve  the  inclusion  of  content  blocks  such  as  feature  lists  or  quotes  from 
external sources and pulling out social media posts. In operating models for 
products, digital or analog, there is a great need for content that has some sort 
of kinesis. We propose the following principles for creating kinetic content that 
facilitates ContentOps:

• Focus on information enablement.
• Automate continuous delivery pipelines.
• Improve collaboration across value streams.
• Make semantics the foundation.
• Consider technical capabilities.

Focus on Information Enablement

Information enablement means having full command of information and being 
able to leverage computation power that can scale infinitely. 

Information  enablement  is  evidenced  in  several  ways.  Salim  Ismail  (2020) 
lays out three forms of information enablement—each of which can be applied 
to technical communication products and processes:

Operationalizing Content Creation  45

• Turning traditional functions from analog to digital. Rather than distribut-
ing “documents” with a tl;dr (too long; didn’t read) amount of information, 
enable information to be surfaced to the right audiences, at the right time 
in the user journey, in the right language, in the right format, and so on. 
An example would be to show explanations of automobile functions in an 
augmented reality app rather than in a printed manual.

• Harnessing information at scale. Organizations need to utilize information 
and  data  produced  as  needed  and  at  scale.  In  technical  communication, 
this means creating content in small, discrete units so that it can be auto-
aggregated into new information assets, with content variables that can be 
auto-populated as part of the delivery process.

• Leveraging and harnessing information streams. Content can serve as a cata-
lyst to generate data, and that data can be further contextualized to create a  
new information stream. The content of a health-monitoring app is valu-
able in that it guides a user in how to use the app, but then the user-entered 
data can add further value, as the app analyzes that data and serves it back 
up to the user (Ismail, 2020).

Automate Continuous Delivery Pipelines

Authors working within Agile environments (mentioned in chapter 2 of this 
collection) are likely aware of how a continuous delivery pipeline works. Rather 
than creating content during product development and delivering a compre-
hensive set of documents to be published with the product release, content is 
created and released sprint by sprint, alongside the product code.

The benefit of content availability is not limited to allowing the automation 
of a delivery pipeline. Content consumers have come to expect content that 
is current, accurate, in the right language, refers to the right geographic area, 
and meets any accessibility needs they may have. Being able to personalize 
content by all of these criteria, simultaneously and automatically, is no longer 
a luxury. Doing this for product content can be particularly complex, and a 
robust and well-planned operating model is the only way to enable person-
alization at scale.

Improve Collaboration across Value Streams

First, content must be recognized as a value stream, and then it must have the 
ability  to  be  used  across  an  enterprise  without  obstacles.  This  leads  to  con-
tent interoperability, which can be defined as the ability of a range of systems, 
devices,  and  applications  to  access,  exchange,  integrate,  and  use  content—a 
definition adapted from the Healthcare Information and Management Systems 
Society (HIMSS, 2021). 

46  Content Operations from Start to Scale

This principle dictates that interoperability must be possible in an automated 
way, without manual intervention or remediation, within and across content 
assets, departments, products, and organizations, with seamless portability. 

Make Semantics the Foundation

Information science recognizes three main types of metadata: administrative, 
structural, and descriptive. We list them here with brief definitions taken from 
Metadata Matters by John Horodyski.

• Administrative metadata “provides information that helps manage an asset. 
Two  common  subsets  of  administrative  data  are  rights  management  meta-
data, which deals with intellectual property rights, and preservation metadata, 
which contains information needed to archive and preserve a resource.” 

• Structural metadata “indicates how compound objects are put together—
for example, how a digital image is configured as provided in Exchangeable 
Image File (EXIF) data, or how pages are ordered to form chapters.” 

• Descriptive  metadata  “describes  an  asset,  an  object,  an  item  for  discov-
ery and identification as you would do in a search on Google or any other 
search tool. It includes elements such as title, creator, author, and keywords.” 
(Horodyski, 2022, p. 16)

This classification of metadata, however, doesn’t tell the whole story. The three 
types of metadata work together to create possibilities beyond what any one  
of them can allow by itself. The three forms of information enablement abso-
lutely depend on content being semantic. Semantically rich content “is content 
to  which  we’ve  added  machine-readable  information  that  describes  the  con-
tent. Semantic information can be conveyed through both structure and meta-
data” (Rockley et al., 2015, p. 110). What allows the programmatic processing 
to show the right content to a particular user at a particular time, and to do 
so at scale, is the existence of applications that read and process any metadata 
attached to a piece of content. The more metadata is attached to a piece of con-
tent, the more likely that piece of content can surface at the appropriate time.

• Structural  metadata  reveals  the  relationship  between  elements  within  a 
single piece of content—and relationships between pieces of content. For 
example, the first paragraph of an article or page may have metadata indi-
cating that it is the heading or title; the second paragraph may have meta-
data indicating that it is a description. Structural metadata might indicate a 
list or list items, a footnote, and so on. This is a good first step toward find-
ing the right piece of content from a large repository, but more semantics 
are needed to help pull out a specific piece of content.

Operationalizing Content Creation  47

• Categorization  semantics  help  determine  intent.  In  other  words,  why  
would  a  user  want  to  read  this  piece  of  content?  This  can  determine  the 
difference, for example, between looking for a pizzeria to dine at, buying a 
pizza pan or stone, finding a recipe for pizza, or learning about where pizza 
was invented.

Metadata  can  be  added  at  different  stages  of  the  production  process,  
from before a piece of content is created, during the authoring process, down 
the line in the supply chain, to when the content is being delivered to the pre-
sentation layer. The use of metadata is what allows us to plan for change. As new  
contexts  reveal  themselves,  as  new  devices  are  brought  into  the  mix,  as  
new  applications  are  developed,  the  content  can  be  ready.  Metadata  helps 
future-proof ContentOps.

Consider Technical Capabilities

We  can  describe  technical  capability  as  having  sufficient  tools,  technologies, 
and skills to allow an enterprise to operate with efficiency. Without a robust, 
fit-for-purpose set of tools, the ability to operationalize content production can 
be seriously hampered. Sadly, this is the case all too often. Content producers, 
from subject matter expert authors to technical communicators, are provided 
with software—such as word processors or software development platforms or 
databases disguised as spreadsheets—and expected to create kinetic content.

In the context of ContentOps, technical capability means using production-
grade  software,  with  customized  interfaces,  that  allows  content  producers 
to  move  efficiently  down  the  content  supply  chain  from  authoring  to  deliv-
ery.  This  also  means  being  able  to  manipulate  content  with  the  granularity 
needed, which could mean supporting significant amounts of variants, reuse,  
and adaptiveness. 

Some of the questions to pose when determining whether a content team has 

the right technology in place are whether they can accomplish the following:

• Automate portions of authoring, through transclusions, AI, or other means.
• Add metadata to content categories during the planning process.
• Create modular content components.
• Have the software validate their content structure as they write.
• Categorize content with metadata during the authoring process.
• Support authors to optimize content quality.
• Transfer content to and from a translation management system.
• Track localized content back to the source language.
• Track and record events during workflow for audit purposes.
• Assign metadata to images, including alt text for accessibility purposes.

48  Content Operations from Start to Scale

• Aggregate content components into larger content documents.
• Eliminate manual steps by automating these tasks with software.
• Rely on automated delivery of content to its end point. 

Conventions vs. Standards

When  creating  content  for  a  level  of  robustness  where  it  could  be  combined, 
recombined, and aggregated for multiple outputs, there is a need for tight con-
ventions and standards. Search engine results reveal that these terms tend to be 
used interchangeably. However, as Rahel has taught for many years now, there are 
critical differences between the two concepts, and confusing them can be the dif-
ference between contributing to a successful model or having one that is subpar.

Editorial Conventions

Conventions can be thought of as editorial patterns that contribute to human 
comprehension.  However,  conventions  are  not  hard-and-fast  rules.  Conven-
tions can be shifted as needed to conform to a particular genre. Table 4.1 shows 
an example in which conventions help us understand the structural elements of 
a document, which are readily identified by virtue of their placement in relation 
to other elements.

Figure 4.1: Sample of conventions in the screenwriting format. Credit: Carlos 

Evia, with content from Oscar Wilde’s The Importance of Being Earnest.

This specific convention applies to Latin script languages and other left-to-
right languages. Left-to-right languages, such as Hebrew or Arabic, will have 
different  conventions,  as  will  logographic  languages  such  as  Chinese,  alpha-
betic syllabary languages such as Korean, and languages with a range of other 
types of scripts.

Figure 4.1 shows an example of a convention specific to scriptwriting. There 
are  prescribed  formatting  conventions  for  elements  such  as  scene  headings, 
actions, character names, and dialogue. The rule about left-aligned text helping 
comprehension does not apply in this industry. Scriptwriters and readers are 
accustomed to the formatting and know how to interpret it.

Some  conventions  are  not  based  on  a  notation  system  or  genre  but  have 
become  codified  arbitrarily  along  geographic  or  cultural  lines.  For  example, 
book titles on spines follow local conventions. Books in the UK, US, English 
Canada,  Scandinavia,  the  Netherlands,  and  the  Commonwealth  have  spine 
titles that are right side up when books are stacked face up. Most of continen-
tal Europe, Latin America, and French Canada have spine titles that are right  
side  up  when  the  books  are  stacked  face  down.  In  languages  with  Chinese-
influenced writing systems, the title is written top-to-bottom.

Breaking with convention does not impede comprehension. For example, the 
advertising copy for a hamburger in Figure 4.2 does not follow a standard or even 
a convention. The usual order of headline, slogan, sub-headline, and body copy 
has been reordered for stronger reader impact. The order of the elements may be 
unique to this advertisement, yet people can understand the message. This would 
not be the case on the technical side, as we will discuss in the next section.

Technical Standards

A  standard,  according  to  the  British  Standards  Institute,  is  an  agreed-on  way 
of doing something. It could be about making a product, managing a process,

delivering a service, or supplying materials. Standards can cover a huge range of 
activities undertaken by organizations and used by their customers. Standards 
are the distilled wisdom of people with expertise in their subject matter and who 
know the needs of the organizations they represent—people such as manufactur-
ers, sellers, buyers, customers, trade associations, users, or regulators (BSI, n.d.).
The  best-known  standards  body  is  the  ISO  (International  Organization  for 
Standardization),  with  close  to  170  national  standards  bodies  that  have  devel-
oped over 21,000 international standards. Groups of experts in a particular topic 
work together to ensure that everything from units of measurement to quality to 
video coding works seamlessly together by conforming to a particular standard. 
There are many other standards bodies. For example, ANSI (the American 
National  Standards  Institute)  administers  and  coordinates  the  US  voluntary 
standards and conformity assessment system. AIM—a global industry alliance 
for  stakeholders—covers  radio-frequency  identification  (RFID),  barcoding, 

Operationalizing Content Creation  51

smart  devices,  and  other  automatic  identification  and  data  capture  (AIDC) 
technologies supporting blockchain, Internet of Things, and real-time locating 
applications. The IEEE SA (the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 
Standards  Association)  develops  standards  across  a  range  of  industries.  This 
is what ensures that electrical and digital devices can interoperate seamlessly.

The following are the standards bodies with the most relevance to content 

production.

• OASIS Open—Organization for the Advancement of Structured Informa-
tion  Standards.  Produces  open  standards  for  SGML,  XML,  DITA,  Doc-
Book,  XLIFF,  and  CMIS,  among  another  thirty  standards.  The  standards 
mentioned here fall squarely within the realm of Content Operations. Many 
of these are markup languages that make it easier for content producers to 
manage content—more efficient authoring, editing, tagging with metadata, 
reusing,  revising,  and  generating  multiple  outputs.  Other  standards  help 
with  the  seamless  transfer  of  content  between  systems,  whether  between 
an authoring system and translation management system, between content 
management systems, or between other types of systems.

• W3C—the World Wide Web Consortium Open Web Platform. Produces 
standards for application development. This includes standards for build-
ing and rendering web pages, including HTML, CSS, SVG, Ajax, and other 
technologies for web applications. HTML is the best-known markup stand-
ard for content.

• Ecma  International—originally  the  European  Computer  Manufacturers 
Association. Founded in 1961 to standardize computer systems in Europe, 
it  now  involves  companies  worldwide  that  produce,  market,  or  develop 
computer or communication systems. JSON, Office Open XML, and Java 
are Ecma standards. 

Standards,  whether  for  devices  or  content,  ensure  interoperability.  The  
reason you can plug an appliance into an outlet and be confident that the appli-
ance will work is because of a range of standards that work together. In fact, 
the reason that you can be confident that the connector on an appliance can be 
plugged into an outlet is because of standards.

In  the  content  realm,  standards  ensure  that  content  is  delivered  faithfully, 
seamlessly,  and  automatically.  Standards  do  not  affect  editorial  conventions, 
but they do affect how content producers create content.

How Conventions and Standards Work Together

Combining technical standards with editorial conventions is the right move to 
ensure that systems will deliver content to its endpoint accurately, and, once 
the content gets there, that it makes sense to the readers. For example, compare

the editorial elements of a news release and an event (Table 4.2), both of which 
have the same elements, aside from one genre-specific element (status vs. address).
When content management systems are faced with these two technical con-
tent  types,  or  schemas,  the  systems  can  parse  the  elements  and  process  the  
content  quite  easily.  Applying  a  different  formatting  style  sheet  to  each  of  
the  published  outputs  could  format  the  content  to  look  very  different—the 
news release could be very plain, while the announcement of an event could 
look  more  like  an  invitation.  However,  that  does  not  tell  the  whole  story  of 
what  a  computer  can  understand  and  what  humans  can  understand.  What 
makes the difference to a person is the editorial content within each of these 
elements. Even if one were to assume that the two content assets were from the 
same company and shared a single voice, the tone would be different. The news 
release will have a particular tone appropriate to the genre; the event announce-
ment will also have a genre-appropriate tone.

In the example from Table 4.2, the way that content is constructed is rela-
tively straightforward. If the content were to be single sourced, reusing all of 
the common elements, then creating it could be a little more challenging. In the 
following section, we will focus on the challenges involved in creating content 
for a complex environment—an operating model that needs content to be auto-
matically discoverable, reusable, reconfigurable, and adaptable. 

Putting Editorial Conventions to Use

Editorial conventions fall into a couple of subcategories: structure-related and 
copywriting-related. Both work together within an operating model that allows 

Operationalizing Content Creation  53

for efficiency in content production and delivery—and effectiveness in com-
munication and comprehension.

When analyzing content from an operational point of view, it is helpful to 
distinguish between levels of complexity when dealing with the written word. 
Considering the differences between concepts may seem pedantic now, but it 
can make the setup and configuration of content much easier when, for exam-
ple,  a  supervisor  or  client  requires  more  personalization,  or  modeling  for 
omnichannel distribution, or granularized delivery to downstream systems.

• Copy, as carried out by a copywriter, is the act of producing words. Some 
definitions  limit  copywriting  to  the  genres  of  advertising  or  promotional 
copy, but in the wider context of content professionals, copy refers to the 
wordsmithing aspect of writing. There may be some attention paid to edito-
rial conventions but not to the technical aspects that improve ContentOps.
• Metadata is “data about data,” but its self-referential nature does not illu-
minate its importance in the realm of content production. Adding meta-
data to copy provides critical functionality that allows computer systems to 
understand how to process content. Metadata is part of the larger field of 
semantics—using signs and symbols to derive intent, most commonly for 
search but also for many other contexts.

• Content is the substance within a container, such as the material between a 
pair of tags. It can also be defined as contextualized data. As Carlos alluded 
to  in  the  introduction  to  this  volume,  in  the  Content  Operations  arena, 
these definitions can be combined to form the following equation:

Copy + Metadata = Content

To bring this concept to life, consider the following example, popularized 
by Rahel. An extremely simple piece of copy is written: 12. As there is no 
context, neither person nor machine  would understand its  significance. 
As  soon  as  the  metadata  of  “month”  is  added  (<month>12</month>),  
a  computer  system  could  interpret  12  to  mean  the  twelfth  month  and  
display  the  results  accordingly.  A  person  reading  “December,”  or  even 
“12th month,” can then derive meaning that would not be possible with-
out the metadata.

Content asset is a collection of content recognizable as a particular type. Com-
mon examples are outputs, such as a printed document or a web page, or by 
genre, such as recipe or an event. Before the web, the most common example 
was a document, whether a single page or a full book. Today, a content asset can 
range from a single word or symbol, which could be a label on the button of a 
user interface, to a collection of content that becomes voice command routines 
for controlled virtual assistants.

54  Content Operations from Start to Scale

Taking this distinction a step further is the addition of metadata to structure 
as well as copy. This type of content is called intelligent content, and it is the key 
to a high-functioning operating model.

Principles of Intelligent Content

The principles of intelligent content, as articulated by Rockley et al. (2015) in 
Intelligent Content: A Primer, have become accepted by content professionals 
across diverse industries. These principles are the foundation of content eco-
systems where considerations such as personalization and publishing at scale 
are paramount.

Intelligent content is structurally rich and semantically categorized. The ben-
efits of intelligent content are that the content becomes discoverable, reusable, 
reconfigurable, and adaptable. In practical terms, consider what this means:

• Structurally rich. Content is structured in a way that computers can under-

stand how to use it.

• Semantically categorized. The content has metadata that gives the content 
container more meaning, so that the content can be processed with more 
specificity.

These dual aspects of intelligent content assist a content team in four ways. 

1.  Content becomes automatically discoverable. Search engines, whether within 
an application, on-site, or publicly available ones, can find the right content 
because  they  understand  not  only  the  words  but  their  intended  meaning. 
The  function  could  mean  something  as  straightforward  as  a  CMS  rule  to 
“find any content with a particular tag” (for example, “troubleshooting”) and 
display it on a page about troubleshooting. An example from the world of 
e-commerce  is  the  method  for  distinguishing  multiple  products  with  the 
same name. Multiple products called “flags” could have metadata that dis-
ambiguates an advertising flag from a national flag from a Post-It tape flag.
2.  Content becomes reusable. A particular piece of content can be written 
once and reused many times, whether across multiple information prod-
ucts or within the same piece of information. The content, with its seman-
tic categorization, is stored, and every time that piece of content is needed, 
the system issues an instruction for that content, tagged with that particu-
lar metadata, to be included in the right place within a content asset. An 
example might be reusing the phrase, “Be sure to use non-scratch utensils 
only.” Being able to write it once and use it thousands of times across reci-
pes on a website saves time in writing (and later, in possible editing); pro-
motes consistency; and drives significant savings at the time of translation.

Operationalizing Content Creation  55

3.  Content becomes reconfigurable. The content can be aggregated in mul-
tiple  ways,  without  manual  intervention,  to  meet  a  new  need.  Adding 
enough semantics at the time of content creation means that the content 
has  enough  future-proofing  to  allow  its  use  in  new  contexts  with  mini-
mum fuss. A good example is that structurally rich information, such as 
flight, hotel, and car rental reservations, can be used in aggregation sites 
to do product comparisons but can also be used to set up a travel manage-
ment instance on a service such as TripIt, or be pulled into your calendar 
for easy viewing, or be combined into some new information product that 
is yet to be invented.

4.  Content becomes adaptable. The content can change its look and feel auto-
matically, because the formatting is kept separate from the content itself. 
In other words, when delivering content to a specific channel, the content 
can be formatted automatically according to the styling rules for the size 
and profile of the device. Compare how LinkedIn articles, for example, are 
displayed on a mobile phone versus on a laptop computer.

Planning for an Operating Model Based on Intelligent Content

The first phase in a content life cycle is planning, and planning has never been 
more important than when preparing content for a production pipeline in a 
high-efficiency operating model. The structural metadata and semantic catego-
rization need to cover at least three basic life cycles—the customer life cycle, 
the product life cycle, and the content life cycle—and plan for multiple output 
variants. The following example demonstrates the complexity of setting up a 
content ecosystem to enable the right content to be written and tagged for auto-
mated delivery by the systems at the publication end.

By  mapping  each  touchpoint  on  the  customer  life  cycle  to  the  product  
life cycle, ContentOps is improved because content creators have identified the 
following:

• Which content needs to be created for each touchpoint, ensuring that there 

are no content gaps as the customer moves along their journey.

• Which  content  is  needed  for  each  stage  of  the  product  life  cycle,  from  
the  time  a  product  is  launched  until  it  is  retired  and  replaced  with  a  
new version.

Each piece of content can be turned into intelligent content as it is created, 
which allows it to be surfaced to customers at the appropriate moment in their 
journeys. For example, a customer looking to get a software license for a new 
digital product will get a different message than a customer who wants to renew 
a license to a similar product that is about to be retired.

56  Content Operations from Start to Scale

Each piece of content can also be categorized by a number of other factors: 
from  the  device  and  platform  being  used—think  of  slight  variants  between 
instructions for an iPhone vs. an Android phone—or by level of expertise, by 
geographic  market,  by  language,  and  so  on.  Adding  metadata  provides  the 
many benefits of intelligent content.

If  a  company  were  to  create  unique  content  assets  for  each  variant  shown 
in Table 4.4, that would result in an exponential proliferation of content that 
would then need to be maintained. Changes are made to a product (or to how 
a  feature  works)  relatively  frequently,  and  that  has  a  tremendous  impact  on 
maintenance of multiple pieces of content. Using intelligent content principles, 
the proliferation of source content can be kept to a minimum. This means that 
instead of creating a separate piece of content for each variable, as shown in 
Table 4.4, a single piece of source content could include specific content com-
ponents, shown in Table 4.3. For example, if content is needed in the Discover

stage,  that  single  piece  of  content  could  include  variants  to  cover  all  device 
types, audiences, markets, and so on.

A content team can use editorial techniques to support ContentOps in at least 
two ways. One way involves structure; the other involves writing. These two 
aspects  work  together  to  create  fit-for-purpose  content  that  works  to  deliver 
into multiple outputs and to multiple audiences.

Applying Editorial Structure to Copy

The structural considerations for creating content that works within a complex 
content ecosystem, where automation for scale is important, can be linked to 
the design philosophy of minimalism. The concepts associated with minimal-
ism were developed in the 1980s and 1990s by John Carroll and his colleagues 
at  IBM,  and  they  led  to  modularity—the  chunking  of  content  into  modules. 
Carroll’s publications, including “The Minimal Manual” (1987), The Nurnberg 
Funnel (1990), and Minimalism beyond the Nurnberg Funnel (2003), demon-
strate how minimalism is anchored in instructional design principles, making 
it easier for adults to absorb practical information.

Minimalism

The  minimalist  approach  to  designing  instruction  and  documentation  com-
bined  cognitive  psychology  and  instructional  design  to  look  at  the  science 
behind how people absorb information. The approach relies on task orienta-
tion to produce more effective learning and more rapid performance outcomes.
The four main design principles of minimalism, as summarized by Hans van 

der Meij and Carroll (1995), are:

• Choose  an  action-oriented  approach.  Users  typically  want  to  do  things. 

This principle reflects the use-centeredness of minimalism.

• Anchor the tool in the task domain. A tool is a means to an end. This prin-
ciple asks designers to select training tasks that are meaningful for the user.
• Support error recognition and recovery. To err is human. There are several 
ways to increase user competence and comfort levels in handling mistakes. 
• Support reading to do, study, and locate. Designs must fit as much as pos-
sible the diverging needs and propensities of the intended audience. This 
principle reflects the user-centeredness of minimalism.

Minimalism  dictates  that  authors  must  know  their  users  and  their  needs 
and  can  understand  their  goals,  tasks,  and  interactions.  Content  is  used 
out of “sequence,” and in that regard, there is a need for content that can be 

58  Content Operations from Start to Scale

automatically pulled, according to the requirements of the moment, and deliv-
ered into multiple contexts. This becomes the backbone of ContentOps.

Modularity

If minimalism is a design philosophy, then modular content is the embodiment 
of that philosophy. Well-written modular content works somewhat like Lego 
blocks. The blocks are not the same size or color, but they are manufactured in 
predictable shapes and sizes, which makes it possible to build larger structures. 
A simple example is shown in Figure 4.3.

For modular content to work within a scalable ecosystem, it must have the 

following characteristics:

• A  module  must  be  a  discrete,  self-contained,  reusable  unit  of  information. 
One recommendation is that the size of the unit should be the smallest logical 
stand  alone piece of information. In some cases, this could be a sentence, a para- 
graph, or a larger collection of elements that work together as a cohesive unit.
• A module must have enough associated metadata to allow it to be pulled by 
a system in a way that ensures that content is shown at the right time, in the 
right place, to the right audience. This is the mechanism behind personali-
zation, among other purposes.

• Each module must follow a common schema. This allows systems to pro-
cess  content  with  reliability,  as  the  structural  metadata  indicates  content 
type, purpose, and intent to those systems.

Rahel Bailie.

Operationalizing Content Creation  59

• Each  module  must  be  portable,  so  that  the  modules  can  be  mixed  and 
matched  with  other  modules  to  build  a  creative  whole.  Each  module  
(and all of them as a whole) must maintain a level of coherence for the con-
tent’s purpose to avoid remixing content just for the sake of remixing. Meta-
data can help with this process of assemblage and reconfiguration based on 
audience and purpose. 

Understanding how modular content can be is a key part of understanding 

how to create an efficient system for ContentOps.

Applying Writing Techniques

Learning about writing techniques is an ever-changing, never-ending journey. 
As norms change, both in reader expectations and the demands of products 
and technologies, content teams will be challenged to determine which tech-
niques are most appropriate to their ContentOps. Having said that, operating 
models  can  be  quite  varied;  there  will  be  a  need  to  continually  evaluate  the 
appropriateness of writing techniques to feed the content ecosystem.

Five  core  editorial  practices  are  fundamental  to  working  within  a  high- 
efficiency operating model. The paradox of the advice to adopt these five prac-
tices  is  the  caveat  that  comes  with  that  advice:  don’t  fully  adopt  these  five  
practices. Sometimes, the problem will be that a principle of one practice con-
tradicts the principles of another practice. At other times, the problem will be 
that the principles to make copy more friendly to read can backfire when used 
in a complex content ecosystem where contexts can change, depending on the 
reuse scenario. Combine the best and most appropriate practices to suit a par-
ticular operating model. 

1. Plain Language

The  Plain English movement began in the UK in the  mid-twentieth  century 
as a way to help the average resident complete overly complicated government 
forms. Today, most English-speaking countries have a government mandate to 
produce content in Plain English. Given the number of languages and the range 
of grammatical constructions, there is no single right or wrong way to go about 
writing  in  plain  language—though  for  the  audience  of  this  book,  the  source 
language will overwhelmingly be English. Instead, adopt and adapt: adopt the 
ethos of the practice and adapt it to the languages used by your organization.

The principles of plain language are designed to allow readers to concentrate on 
the message rather than be distracted by complicated language. These principles 
were inspired by and adapted from the work of Robert Eagleson (1990). The ethos 

60  Content Operations from Start to Scale

of plain language is to “keep it simple without dumbing down the message,” and 
the guidelines for writing in plain language copy can be summarized as follows.

• Write using active voice to make the meaning clearer, and use first-person, 

informal address when possible.

• Break complex sentences into smaller chunks. Limit each sentence to a sin-

gle concept. Don’t break a concept into multiple sentences.

• Compose short sentences with simple structures. Use a subject-verb-object 
structure. Keep readability appropriate for “skip, skim, scan” reading patterns.

• Use common words—and fewer words when possible.
• Edit out irrelevant information.
• Avoid idioms and fuzzy language.
• Agree with a structure to set context involving the author and the reader.
• Keep the message brief and focused.

There are several benefits of using plain language writing techniques. Plain 
language is easier to read for all reading levels. Readers with low literacy skills 
will have an easier time reading, and readers with higher literacy skills will find 
it easier to skim the content. It’s also harder for inconsistencies and inaccura-
cies to creep into plain language. Passive voice can hide who is taking an action, 
whereas active voice sentence structure promotes clarity.

In  a  complex  content  ecosystem,  certain  aspects  of  plain  language  are  not 
practical  to  implement.  For  example,  using  pronouns  such  as  “it”  or  “their” 
can have unintended consequences when content is reused. When the pronoun 
begins a piece of content that follows a new piece of content, the pronoun may 
make an inappropriate reference. Given that a high percentage of readers don’t 
understand the rules for pronoun reference, using the noun instead of the pro-
noun is recommended.

2. Controlled Language

Controlled  natural  language  works  hand-in-hand  with  plain  language  and 
global readiness. Controlled vocabularies are often specific to an industry, such 
as aviation or medicine.

Simplified  English  is  a  predetermined  set  of  words  and  writing  rules  spe-
cifically made to help write instructions and instruction manuals so that any 
individual in the world can clearly understand the manual. It is especially help-
ful for those whose native language isn’t English. Simplified Technical English 
(ASD-STE100, 2021) is likewise a predetermined collection of words and writ-
ing rules, classified as a “controlled language,” that was initially developed by 
the aerospace industry and later adopted by other industries. Controlled natu-
ral language focuses on simplifying technical instructions.

Common writing rules for controlled natural language include the following.

Operationalizing Content Creation  61

• Having a dictionary of acceptable terms, to force consistency and decrease 

comprehension errors.

• Setting only one meaning and word form for each word. This means that a 
word such as “list” would have one meaning, either tilting of a boat or enu-
merating items, and if used as a verb, it could not also be used as a noun. To 
reduce complexity, choosing the simplest term possible is encouraged. Homo-
nyms and polysemous (words with multiple meanings) words are forbidden. 
Because controlled language is about precision, the use of pronouns is elimi-
nated, as is the use of synonyms.

In an operating model where controlled natural language would help with 
content production efficiencies at scale, then likely content optimization soft-
ware would be used to automate terminology and grammatical compliance.

3. Global Readiness

Your  content  may  not  have  a  global  audience—or,  should  we  say,  not  that  you 
know of. Even if your audience is a single country or market, chances are that the 
audience is not homogeneous. Some of the audience may have English as a second 
(or third, or fourth) language or be used to a different type of English. Others may 
understand English well enough but struggle with idioms or cultural memes.1

Global readiness affects not only content—what is displayed  and  its meta-
data—but also the taxonomy, which can feed a navigation scheme; image cap-
tions and callouts; the titling, captions, and metadata behind it; podcast titling 
and transcription; and transactional copy, such as navigation and interface text, 
labels, and help, error, and administrative messages. Val Swisher, in books such 
as Global Content Strategy: A Primer (2014) and The Personalization Paradox 
(2021),  provides  guidelines  for  writing  for  a  global  audience,  such  as  using 
present  tense  in  sentence  construction;  avoiding  passive  voice;  and  avoiding 
abbreviations,  noun  strings,  and  gerunds.  Likewise,  Loy  Searle  analyzes  the 
concept of localization (and related practices) for ContentOps in chapter 7 of 
the present volume. 

The considerations are many, and in some ways, they are a moving target—the 
fluidity of language could mean that a culturally sensitive image this year could 
be a problem next year. It is important to understand how global readiness for a 
body of content can affect ContentOps. Translating content with minimal human 
intervention, producing alternate-language content that follows corporate guide-
lines,  and  meeting  regulatory  requirements  are  all  operational  considerations. 
(The  idea  that  consumers  expect  brands  to  have  good,  usable  content  may  be 
outside of the scope of Content Operations but is certainly a nontrivial issue.)

1  Vivid  examples  can  be  found  on  YouTube  by  searching  “Complete  the  Meme,”  

“Finish the Meme,” and “Strange English Idioms.”

4. Accessibility

Keeping  content  accessible  warrants  discussion,  because  many  countries 
require organizations to meet accessibility guidelines. For example, the UK and 
US governments have comprehensive guidelines for accessibility. Because class-
action lawsuits based on lack of accessibility are steadily increasing, attending 
to accessibility is also seen as a risk-management strategy. Producing accessible 
content should not be seen simply as a business obligation—though some com-
panies are more apt to pursue accessibility when they learn that accessibility 
techniques are also beneficial for search engine optimization—but also as a way 
to respect end users, in the way that user experience is seen as a way to serve 
those end users’ needs.

Some accessibility requirements fall within the purview of the technologists, 
such  as  ensuring  that  a  blink  rate  does  not  trigger  epileptic  episodes.  Other 
accessibility requirements are shared between technologists and content pro-
fessionals. For example, technologists ensure that alt-text fields are made avail-
able, and content professionals ensure that they write text that is both accessible 
and meaningful for readers. 

How content is set up for reading makes a large contribution to accessibility. 
The following guidelines are meant to be used in conjunction with the plain 
language, controlled vocabulary, and global readiness already discussed.

• Multiple access methods
 ° Provide multiple forms of content; do not rely on voice-only or text-only 
methods of accessing content.
 ° Consider live interpretation as an option for live content delivery.
• Unique page titles
 ° Identify the subject of the topic or page with the title.
 ° Front-load titles to include important words at the beginning.
 ° Use hyphens as separators for easier reading; do not use ampersands.
• Section headings
 ° Break text up into logical chunks with headings.
 ° Use style sheets to add headings (not in-line formatting).
 ° Give the headings meaningful descriptions.
• Lists and tables
 ° Format lists and nested lists using structure tags.
 ° Use tables only for tabular data.
 ° Ensure that tables can be read properly by screen readers.
• Links and alt text
 ° Use unique descriptive links for hyperlinks and cross-references.
 ° Use canonical links for websites (and test them with a screen reader).
 ° Ensure  that  alt  text  describes  visuals  in  a  way  that  is  meaningful  to  
the reader.

Operationalizing Content Creation  63

 ° Avoid in-line links that interrupt reading; place links at the end of a para-
graph or section.
 ° Write descriptive links to downloadable files.

The  important  thing  to  remember  is  that  content  needs  to  be  accessible 
across  the  board,  not  only  for  users  with  one  type  of  impairment. There  are 
readily available accessibility resources for just about any content question you 
may have, whether thinking about websites, video games, content hubs, techni-
cal documentation, or live presentations.

5. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

In the book From Solo to Scaled, Natalie Marie Dunbar (2022) includes a series 
of recommendations for building a successful content practice. Dunbar urges 
her readers to “embrace the intention of inclusive design: to include everyone, 
regardless  of  differences  in  ability,  gender,  race,  sexual  orientation,  or  other 
characteristics, in the activities of the practice” (p. 134). Dunbar cites the fol-
lowing definitions from Project Inkblot (2019), which, coincidentally, Carlos 
has been using in his introductory college courses on topics related to Content-
Ops after a recommendation from Sarah O’Keefe.

Diversity is quantitative. It’s the composition of different people repre-
sented in what you make and the decision makers on your team.
Inclusion  speaks  to  the  quality  of  the  experience  you’ve  designed  for 
these diverse folks, so they experience themselves as leaders and deci-
sion makers.
Equity lives in how we design our systems and processes; the way we 
work, and who we work with, so we are upholding our commitment to 
diversity and inclusion.

Dunbar adds that building diversity into a content practice “asks you to think 
about who is not represented in your products and services, and what it will 
take to include them—a process that often begins with how you ‘speak’ to users 
with content and how your tone shifts to be inclusive for all” (p. 135).

Although  there  are  no  global  standards  for  incorporating  diversity,  equity, 
and  inclusion  (DEI)  into  writing  and  content—and  those  vary  considerably 
across locales, contexts, and languages—some authors provide specific recom-
mendations. For example, Michael Metts and Andy Welfle (2020), in Writing Is 
Designing, introduce the following guidance on how to write more inclusively:

• Avoid language that assigns value to traits (e.g., say “she uses a wheelchair” 

instead of “she’s confined to a wheelchair”).

64  Content Operations from Start to Scale

• Avoid prescriptive language when talking about people (e.g., say “this soft-
ware helps you create graphics, photographs, and illustrations” instead of 
“this software is for graphic designers, photographers, and illustrators”).
• Adopt the singular “they” (e.g., say “they will be in touch with you” instead 

of “[s]he will be in touch with you”). 

• Read more about inclusivity. 

Talking  about DEI  and ContentOps is  important, but it  is  also  easy  to fall 
into the traps of stereotyping or infantilizing traditionally misrepresented com-
munities. Therefore, we recommend involving DEI experts as consultants or, 
if possible, bringing them on as full-time members of a content team. (In that 
spirit, we invited Jonathan McFadden to write the epilogue of this collection as 
an interplay between content and DEI.)

Content Delivery

In  chapter  8  of  this  collection,  “The  Technology  that  Supports  Content  
Operations,”  Patrick  Bosek  discusses  tools  and  processes  related  to  the  pro-
cessing and delivery of content in complex operational environments. In this 
chapter, and particularly in the next section, we want to emphasize that there is 
a reason for investing in robust ContentOps models and workflows. Actually, 
there are several reasons that relate to saving time for content teams, improving 
content  accuracy  (by  reducing  dependency  on  manual  processes  of  copying 
and pasting, for example), allowing growth and scale of projects, reducing risk 
in regulated industries, improving time to market of information products, and 
increasing trust along the customer journey. Patrick’s chapter provides details 
about  software  and  apps  that  process  and  deliver  content.  Here,  we  want  to 
focus on what can be described as the North Star of robust ContentOps: offer-
ing content as a service instead of publishing it. 

Content as a Service

Content  as  a  Service  (CaaS)  is  about  establishing  interaction  frameworks 
between people, organizations, devices, and services so that there is account-
ability for the resulting behavior and, presumably, a measure of effectiveness 
when viewed from the perspective of all legitimate stakeholders. This adapts 
some  of  the  work  by  Joe  Gollner  (2016),  who  has  made  a  habit  of  working 
with complex content projects. When exploring this level of content flexibility,  
Gollner likes to talk about “authority networks” that link a series of actors lead-
ing up to events such that there is traceability from observable events back to 
the responsible parties. 

Operationalizing Content Creation  65

In order to reach the North Star of CaaS, content should have the following 

characteristics.

• Profiled. The content has been semantically structured in a way that suits 
delivery  for  personalized  use.  For  example,  a  piece  of  content  could  be 
tagged with metadata so that it would be delivered to customers who bought 
a  particular  version  of  a  product,  arriving  at  the  time  that  their  product 
warranty is about to expire. 

• Offered. Rather than publishing content, content is delivered to a neutral 
location, such as a database, and later supplied for use by multiple technolo-
gies. For example, a digital health monitor does not know what the health 
level of its user will be on a particular day, so all potential answers will be 
stored, with the appropriate answer delivered depending on the situation 
on any given day.

• Dynamic. The content, at its source, can be updated as needed and continu-
ously  delivered  to  all  potential  end  points.  For  example,  product  content 
is  being  continuously  created  and  updated  throughout  the  development 
phase, so that it is completed at the same time as the product. 

• Independent. The content is stored as standalone, autonomous units that 
can be used in multiple contexts. Contexts could mean devices, products, 
audiences, and so on—or a combination of contexts.

• Ubiquitous. The content is online, searchable, and findable. 
• Molecular. The content is not formatted as specific documents. Instead, it is 

presented as information molecules.

• Spontaneous. The content will be triggered by contexts.

Gollner  adds  that  content  is  planned,  designed,  created,  managed,  and 
exchanged  as  objects  that  incorporate  not  only  the  editorial  side  of  the  con-
tent but also the associated rules governing the structure and meaning of the 
content. This  means  that  the  content  has  an  array  of  rendition  and  behavior 
processes that a module can use to render that material independently or in 
concert with other content objects. In practical terms, we can see that the con-
tent being managed is highly precise, so that a variety of application processes, 
including multiple rendition scenarios, can operate on that content with a high 
degree  of  confidence  and  effectiveness.  Content  coexists  with  the  complete 
array of known behaviors that it supports, and it is exchanged with stakehold-
ers who will deliver and use the content and behavior in their own environ-
ments to meet their own goals.

Now that we have established the foundations in principles of kinetic con-
tent, the interplay of editorial conventions and technical standards, the struc-
ture-based benefits of intelligent content, and the basics of dynamic processing 
and delivery, in the next section we introduce a model for determining the level 
of robustness of a ContentOps implementation.

66  Content Operations from Start to Scale

Levels of Robustness for ContentOps 

As we introduce our levels of robustness for ContentOps, we acknowledge that  
they  are  partially  inspired  by  the  levels  for  developing  technical  content  
that Alan Pringle and Sarah O’Keefe included in their book Technical Writing 101,  
which  Carlos  cites  frequently  and  to  this  day  includes  in  his  university-level 
courses about content development and  strategy. Alan and Sarah proposed the 
following levels for classifying a methodology for developing technical content:

• Chaos (“there’s no consistency in the presentation of content”)
• Page consistency (“content looks the same on paper [or other delivery for-

mat],” but there’s no consistency in the source files)

• Template-based  authoring  (content  follows  “predetermined  styles  [and] 
writers don’t spend time figuring out how to create particular formatting—
they apply styles to add formatting”)

• Structured  authoring  (“a  publishing  workflow  that  defines  and  enforces 
consistent organization of content”) (Pringle & O’Keefe, 2009, pp. 41–42).

We also acknowledge the maturity model for Content Operations proposed 
by Colleen Jones (2019) to “help your company identify your current level of 
content operations and then decide whether that level will support your con-
tent vision and strategy” (p. 163). The model proposed by Jones includes the 
following levels:

1.  Chaotic: “No formal content operations, only ad hoc approaches”
2.  Piloting: “Trying content operations in certain areas, such as for a blog”
3.  Scaling: “Expanding formal content operations across business functions”
4.  Sustaining:  “Solidifying  and  optimizing  content  operations  across  busi-

ness functions” 

5.  Thriving: “Sustaining while also innovating and seeing return on invest-

ment” (Jones, 2019, p. 164).

Rachel McConnell (2022) mentions workflow, methodologies, and organiza-
tional alignment as some components of Content Operations. When describ-
ing  the  levels  of  robustness,  we  focus  particularly  on  workflows  and  their 
 affordances. Although not all workflows related to ContentOps involve writ-
ing, we base our working definition of the term on the description of a writing 
workflow as the process for completing a literate activity and the tools used in 
that process (Lockridge & Van Ittersum, 2020). Literate activity, as Prior defines 
it, involves “reading, talking, observing, acting, making, thinking, and feeling 
as well as transcribing words on paper” (1998, xi). We believe that this defini-
tion can expand beyond purely literate activities and cover processes and tools 
related to digital content creation for videos, images, maps, graphs, and the like. 

Operationalizing Content Creation  67

We  view  the  concept  of  affordance  based  on  the  following  definition  by  
Carolyn Miller: “A technological affordance, or a suite of affordances, is direc-
tional,  it  appeals  to  us  by  making  some  forms  of  communicative  interaction 
possible or easy and others difficult or impossible, by leading us to engage in or 
attempt certain kinds of rhetorical action rather than others. Affordances both 
enable and constrain, they both pull on us and push at us” (Miller, 2010, p. x). If 
ContentOps were a video game, it would be more a sandbox game than a quest 
adventure. The levels of robustness would be equivalent to levels in the game: as 
the levels go up, so does their operational difficulty, but they also unlock new 
features and benefits (our affordances). Although Player 1 in a sandbox video 
game could advance to a higher level, that does not necessarily mean that they 
have to advance (as opposed to a quest, where there’s a hostage to rescue and/or 
a monster to defeat). The same applies to the levels of robustness in ContentOps: 
a company can be effective at a level that provides the right affordances for the 
company’s scope, audience, and interests. For example, if a small startup only 
generates content for a static website using a building system such as Square-
space, there is no pressing need to advance to a higher level of robustness. Of 
course, if the scope changes and the content needs to scale (say, if the startup is 
acquired by a bigger tech firm), moving to a higher level will be a necessity, and 
the expansion can avoid painful points of friction by adopting the right work-
flows and tools even at a low level of ContentOps robustness. For this reason, 
we are intentionally not labeling the levels of robustness as a maturity model 
for  Content  Operations—which  Jones  (2019)  has  already  proposed.  Without 
getting into a deep criticism of “maturity model” as a construct, we agree with 
Verwijs (2019) in his assertion that “growth is not linear and it doesn’t happen in 
discrete phases marked by convenient external characteristics.” 

The workflows included in the levels of robustness cannot avoid discussions 
of tools and technologies. As Patrick Bosek writes in chapter 8 of this volume, 
ContentOps  could  be  separated  from  technology,  but  practically  speaking,  
the two are deeply intertwined. Finally, we should mention that the levels are 
not absolute and that there’s always variance based on audience, purpose, and 
technological  capabilities  of  any  content  project.  Additionally,  the  workflow 
scenarios included in the levels are broad generalizations based on real cases 
(but fictionalized).

Level 0: Desktop Publishing at the Core of Any Content Work

Robustness  is  weak  or  nonexistent.  Sarah  O’Keefe  has  written  that  Content 
Operations “are not necessarily automated or efficient. If you move information 
from place to place via copy and paste, and have extensive manual quality checks 
in place to catch the inevitable errors, that’s still content ops (albeit inefficient 
and tedious content ops)” (O’Keefe, 2021). Content workflows at level 0 follow 

68  Content Operations from Start to Scale

some  of  those  inefficient  and  tedious  processes  that  probably  can  work  for  a 
small team with one single audience type or one channel for delivery—but most 
likely cannot scale to address the needs of additional audiences and channels.

Sample workflow:  Authors  create  content  in  a  word  processor,  which  can 
be a standalone application on a computer (e.g., Microsoft Word) or a web app 
(e.g., Google Docs). A single content creator (or a small team) operating at this 
level may have a manual style guide in either a physically printed document  
or  book  or  a  desktop  publishing  file.  Authors  create  content  primarily  for  a  
single audience segment. If the information products created at this level need 
to  address  more  than  one  audience  type  (e.g.,  novice  and  advanced  users), 
authors have to create parallel sections in the document(s). The primary chan-
nel of delivery is a printed document or a PDF distributed online or through 
physical digital media. Authors depend on manual processes of copying and 
pasting for updating content, and there is no version control (other than the 
basic tracking features of the selected word processing tool at the center of this 
level). A new version of a document will replace (in some cases permanently) 
the previous version. 

Affordances:  Authors  or  small  teams  can  control  a  few  files  directly  in 
one  single  computer  or  a  cloud-based  drive.  If  using  the  desktop  tool  prop-
erly, authors can generate automated tables of contents that produce clickable 
outcomes in PDF exports. Any products developed at this level are static, and 
updates will require republishing. 

Level 1: Content Moves Online

Robustness is weak but deliverables can be multichannel. Teams operating 
in  level  0  can  easily  move  to  level  1  if  their  audiences’  needs  involve  a  basic 
website. This website can be created with a static HTML template or site builder 
or use a web content management system like WordPress, primarily as a copy-
and-paste  channel  secondary  to  the  core  desktop  publishing  operation  that 
ruled over level 0.

Sample workflow: Similar to level 0, authors in level 1 primarily create con-
tent in a word processing environment and may use a manual style guide for 
conventions. The primary channel for publication still is a printed document 
or a PDF export of this document. The copy-and-paste process in this level can 
include a secondary publishing channel for a basic website. This website can be 
based on a static HTML template or site builder platform, or it can be walled 
by a social media platform like Facebook or Twitter. Author(s) copy and paste 
sections of the word processing tool to an HTML template or to social media 
posts.  In  some  cases,  the  team  may  have  access  to  a  web  CMS  (e.g.,  Drupal 
or WordPress) but use it mainly as a page-oriented copy-and-paste replica of 
their main desktop publishing document. Any updates to the original desktop 

Operationalizing Content Creation  69

publishing source will not be reflected on the website/social media secondary 
channels unless authors perform a new copy and paste (and publish) update. 
Likewise,  any  updates  performed  directly  on  the  secondary  website/social 
media channels will not be reflected on the original desktop publishing source. 
Similar to level 0, any elements in the content that address different audiences 
will need parallel sections. Content teams (which can be very small or consist 
of one person) frequently mix content with interface considerations, and they 
might use a design tool like Figma for development that is locked in a single 
deliverable channel. 

Affordances:  Authors  or  small  teams  can  address  the  needs  of  their  users 
in a rudimentary multichannel approach with a printed/PDF deliverable and 
a website or social media deliverable. If using a web CMS, the team can gain 
basic insights from the tool’s analytics. Teams may start looking at basic terms 
of  content  strategy  and  standards  (primarily  HTML)  to  manage  the  parallel 
publishing channels.

Level 2: Separation of Content from Presentation Opens Doors

Robustness is light. Level 2 is characterized by the adoption of tools and work-
flows that separate content from presentation. Whereas in levels 0 and 1 authors 
were  primarily  working  with  what-you-see-is-what-you-get  desktop  publish-
ing tools and copy-and-paste exports of that content, in level 2, teams can start 
thinking about multichannel publishing and other advanced ContentOps fea-
tures by embracing the separation of content from presentation. This separation, 
however, “can create philosophical and cognitive dissonance for technical com-
municators trained to think of information as content that is inherently linked 
to presentation” (Clark, 2007, p. 36). Mark Baker warned about the difficulties of 
teaching this concept: “One of the hardest things about moving technical writ-
ers from desktop publishing to structured writing is persuading them to give up 
responsibility for how the final output looks. Writers will keep looking for ways 
to specify layout, even in markup languages specifically designed to remove lay-
out concerns. They understand their jobs in terms of the responsibilities their 
old tools imposed on them” (Baker, 2013, p. 87). Therefore, in level 2, authors 
and teams leave the page-oriented core of desktop publishing and focus on con-
tent that will be formatted at a later stage in a publishing process. 

Sample  workflow:  Authors  may  work  primarily  on  a  web  CMS  or  in  a 
developer-friendly text editor. However, their authoring environment does not 
include  decisions  about  layout  or  presentation.  Authors  create  posts,  pages, 
or—in some cases—modules of content that will be assembled and organized 
during  an  automated  publishing  process.  In  a  CMS  or  CCMS  (Component  
Content  Management  System),  authors  can  work  in  interfaces  that  hide  
any  code  behind  their  writing.  In  a  text  editor,  authors  create  content  in 

70  Content Operations from Start to Scale

HTML code or, most likely, in a lightweight markup language like Markdown 
or reStructuredText (file formats that developer communities tend to treat as 
standards). Advanced level 2 teams can adopt conventions and standards (e.g., 
XML,  JSON)  and  avoid  copy-and-paste  practices.  Instead,  the  “raw”  content 
can adopt different presentations as determined by the CMS. In some cases, the 
CMS allows exporting to PDF for print with automated formatting.

Affordances:  The  (primarily  web)  CMS  or  CCMS  used  in  this  level  may 
have built-in version control features that allow authors to revert changes with-
out  losing  information.  Teams  can  exchange  information  without  relying  on  
copy-and-paste techniques. Scaling from a small web CMS to a more robust 
publishing tool is easier than coming from a desktop publishing application. 
Customization  and  filtering  based  on  audience  type  or  other  criteria  still 
require parallel sections. Web CMS tools at this level can have an automated 
feed in an XML grammar that enables basic syndication to other websites and 
even some social media platforms. At this level, content can be perceived as a 
valuable asset and not just a support feature for a product or service.

Level 3: Focus on Structured Content and Multichannel Delivery

Robustness is solid. From this level on, structured content is the foundation 
for  robust  ContentOps. The  need  for  well-structured,  semantically  rich  con-
tent that is human and machine readable is an enabler of the many forces that 
are  shaping  content  conversations  in  industry  and  academia.  Atherton  and 
Hane define structured content as follows: “Structured content is content that 
is planned, developed, and connected outside an interface so that it’s ready for 
any interface. It allows you to define the skeleton of your content before you 
create it. Breaking content into the smallest pieces possible (within reason) so 
that it is free to go anywhere, anytime” (Atherton & Hane, 2018, p. 32). Level 3  
is  primarily  defined  by  the  adoption  of  structured  authoring  practices  that 
move beyond the mainly presentational features of, say, tagging a section title 
with a heading 2 in HTML. Level 3 implementations are frequently driven by 
a  tool  or  platform.  An  organization  can  involve  content  professionals  in  the 
selection  of  such  tools,  but  the  decisions  mainly  come  from  management  or 
information technology departments. Tools in this level can include headless 
CMS  platforms  (content  management  systems  that  separate  what  the  users  
see [the presentation layer] from what the developers and authors create and 
maintain [the backend layer]) with web and app deliverables as main channels 
of publication. 

Sample workflow: The organization embraces content as a valuable asset, and 
the dedicated content team may expand to include authors and also strategist(s)  
and engineer(s). Authors mainly write content in the form of a page or post 
(with  a  website  or  app  as  publication  targets),  but  they  can  write  chunks  of 

Operationalizing Content Creation  71

content  independent  from  a  specific  page  that  then  will  be  aggregated  with 
other chunks at the time of publishing. Behind the scenes, the CMS may struc-
ture content in JSON strings, HTML tags, XML structures, or a combination 
of  those.  Teams  may  follow  a  detailed  content  strategy  with  specific  metrics 
for success, and they probably also adopt standards for style and development. 
Affordances: In level 3, content is managed as computable data. This enables 
single sourcing of content that is stored in one repository and can be assembled 
on the fly, based on audience, purpose, and format criteria. Level 3 also enables 
personalization (more about this in chapters 5 and 6 of this volume) and con-
tent filtering for specific needs. In this level, content can be served as a service 
via  an  API  (application  programing  interface)  that  does  not  require  manual 
publishing from the authoring side. 

Level 4: Highly Structured ContentOps

Robustness is appropriate for highly regulated industries. If level 3 is driven 
by a specific tool or content management platform, level 4 is driven by a content 
standard. Let us rephrase that: Level 4 is driven by the robustness needs (mul-
tiple audiences, multiple languages, multiple deliverables in a highly regulated 
industry  and  environment)  that  only  a  solid  content  standard  for  managing 
and publishing highly structured material can fulfill. One of the most popu-
lar standards in this category is the Darwin Information Typing Architecture 
(DITA). DITA consists of a set of design principles for creating “information-
typed” modules at a topic level and for using that content in delivery modes 
such as online help and product support portals on the web (Day et al., 2001). 
Don  Day—one  of  the  original  developers  of  the  standard—explained  that, 
when naming it, DITA “represented a great deal of messaging in a compact and 
memorable acronym”:

• Darwin: for specialization and how things could “evolve” from a base.
• Information Typing: for representation of knowledge as typed units.
• Architecture: a statement that this was not just a monolithic design but an 
extensible tool that could support many uses. (Day, quoted in DITAWriter, 
2016)

We  (Rahel  and  Carlos)  actually  met  when  we  were  members  of  the  tech-
nical committee  maintaining the DITA standard with the non-profit OASIS. 
However, when we decided to write this edited collection, we established the  
directive  that  we  would  not  make  it  solely  a  mechanism  for  promoting  
the use of DITA over other alternatives that could be used at level 4. For exam-
ple,  many  companies  of  diverse  sizes  have,  with  considerable  limitations— 
particularly  when  it  comes  to  managing  multiple  languages  in  a  content  

72  Content Operations from Start to Scale

repository  or  word/phrase-level  filtering—implemented  and  scaled  Content 
Operations  with  JSON  as  their  standard  for  managing  and  delivering  struc-
tured content. Regardless of the standard, level 4 has the primary characteristic 
of treating content as computable data.

Sample workflow: Authors follow routines and experiences similar to those 
in  level  3,  but  they  also  take  advantage  of  a  powerful  standard  to  annotate 
and comment on the content with metadata and structural elements that will 
enable advanced filtering, automated translation and localization capabilities, 
and behind-the-scenes tags that can happen even at the level of a word or let-
ter. Content is still separated from presentation, and the workflow allows for 
publishing or serving via an API with profiling and filtering. Examples include 
complex medical and pharmaceutical environments where a piece of content 
can be reused on a physician’s tablet, a pharmacy’s label, or the user interface 
of  a  laboratory  machine  with  accuracy  and  real-time  delivery,  but  can  also  
filter  through  a  plethora  of  variables  (e.g.,  prescription  dosage  or  collection  
of symptoms).

Affordances: More than in any other level, the affordances of level 4 focus 
on content reuse. In particular, “efficient content reuse does not involve copy-
and-pasting; instead it uses transclusion, whereby content is authored in one 
location and used by reference in other locations” (Eberlein, 2016, p. 55). Con-
tent in level 4 is highly kinetic and adaptable, and its status as computable data 
enables deep personalization, translation, and localization, with capabilities for 
machine learning and artificial intelligence in processing and serving. Level 4 
also includes the affordances unveiled in level 3, but with more capability for 
growth and development.

Conclusion

We mentioned earlier in this chapter that not all ContentOps require the same 
level  of  robustness.  The  mathematician  Erica  Jen  explains  that  “presence  or 
absence of robustness at one level does not imply presence or absence at another 
level, and perhaps the most interesting cases are those in which the intercon-
nections among components not themselves robust give rise to robustness at 
the aggregate level” (Jen, 2003, p. 14). We see those interconnections as key to 
identifying gaps (and accomplishments) in ContentOps implementations.

In real life, however, content creation is more complicated than sticking to a 
recommended level of robustness or even adopting a specific technical standard 
or writing convention. In complex organizations, different teams could be oper-
ating at disparate levels of robustness (think of content marketing and technical 
communication  with  different  tools  and  deliverables).  Those  areas  of  intercon-
nection  can  allow  organizations  and  teams  to  ventilate  content  silos  and  make 
smart decisions about required tools, training, and outcomes. However, regardless 

Operationalizing Content Creation  73

of  robustness,  a  ContentOps  implementation  would  be  nothing  without  solid  
audience consideration and research, and Kevin P. Nichols focuses on that in the 
following chapter, “Customer Experience and Content Operations.”

Customer Experience  
and Content Operations

Obsess about customer needs—and use that as your compass.

Overview

Customer  experience  and  Content  Operations  remain  inextricably  linked. 
When  organizations  fail  to  recognize  this  fact,  their  customer  experiences 
result in fragmented or unproductive customer content experiences. Broken 
operations  within  a  content  life  cycle  yield  subpar  customer  experiences—
and  conversely,  successful  ContentOps  can  yield  more  successful  customer 
experiences. Today, omnichannel content delivery is crucial for many organi-
zations. Omnichannel content experiences mean that the customer can start 
a task at one touchpoint (such as ordering a product online) and complete it 
at another (such as picking it up in a store) without feeling as if the experience 
is disrupted.

The concept of omnichannel delivery has emerged in the past few years to help 
organizations  think  through  how  to  orchestrate  seamless  content  experiences. 
Whereas  multichannel  delivery  focuses  on  the  processes  and  technologies  for 
delivering content across an array of channels and devices, omnichannel focuses 
on coordinating activities across departmental silos to achieve a consistent mes-
sage to users wherever they interact with an organization (OmnichannelX, n.d.). 
Figure 5.1 presents a graphic view of the omnichannel experience, with diverse 
channels of interaction, levels of participation, and stages through the process of 
a customer interacting with content. 

COVID-19  presented  the  world—and  businesses—with  many  challenges. 
For global brands, the pandemic forced workers to remain largely at home, and 
almost overnight, many businesses had to put much of their supply-chain man-
agement processes and content into cloud-based solutions. The importance of 
content within the customer experience became amplified, as customer interac-
tion with content at every touchpoint was intensified by the demands of a shelter-
in-place economy. Customer relationships with brands have always required con-
tent to support them, but never had the customer experience of content been so 
pivotal. During 2020, content was often the only element driving customer inter-
actions with brands. As businesses struggled to maintain or retain their existing 
customer experience models while delivering their services and products, break-
points and issues within their ContentOps workflows were exposed. Such issues 
could cause further fissures within already fragmented customer experiences.

This chapter explores the concepts of customer experience, customer jour-
ney, and content and examines their importance for brands and organizations. 
I will explore the relationships among these concepts before making the case 

Customer Experience and Content Operations  77

for where each falls within ContentOps. A solid understanding of the customer 
journey, and its stages, is necessary to frame its relationship to content and its 
role in ContentOps. 

Customer Experience and Customer Journeys

A  customer  journey  represents  the  relationship  that  a  customer  has  with  a 
brand, and it reflects the “path” that that customer takes while engaging with 
the brand. As a tool that brands leverage, several different types of customer 
journeys exist. This chapter explores a high-level customer journey map and 
specific customer journeys within it.

Let us turn for a moment to explore the relationship between customer expe-
rience,  content,  and  brands.  By  “brands,”  I  mean  how  a  person  perceives  an 
organization externally: the external manifestation of an organization within 
consumer perception. By “customer,” I mean any potential or existing obtainer 
or  consumer  of  a  particular  brand’s  services,  offerings,  or  experiences.  First, 
let’s start by defining a “customer journey,” a term familiar in marketing and 
customer experience departments.

Customer  journey:  Represents  the  broadest  category  of  journeys  and 
includes any and all types of customer journeys below. Simply put, a customer 
journey includes the “path” that a customer takes when engaging with a par-
ticular brand or organization. Often, “customer journey” is used interchangea-
bly with “customer journey map,” but a customer journey map reflects a specific 
type of customer journey and contains specific parameters, which a journey—
much more general—does not. 

Customer journey map: This is the most common type of customer journey and 
the one with which most people are probably familiar. A customer journey map 
visually represents the life cycle of a customer’s engagement with a specific brand 
and includes the following elements:

• An actor (also known as a customer type, customer profile, customer segment, 

or persona). The archetype or profile upon which the journey is based.

• The end-to-end scenario. This represents the action taking place and often 

may refer to the entire life cycle that the map represents.

• Phases within the scenario. The stages, sometimes referred as “steps,” that 

reflect the phases of the customer’s path.

• Emotional  or  intellectual  response.  The  thought  processes  or  emotional 
response that a customer possesses as they complete each action or phase.
• Triggers. Any antecedents that trigger an action or propel the actor to take 

action.

• Opportunities. Noteworthy possibilities provided within each phase, which 
include  potential  content  options,  such  as  thought  leadership  insights  or 
loyalty rewards content.

Brands use customer journeys to build customer-centric brand experiences. 
A well-executed customer journey provides the blueprint for who a customer 
is, how that person behaves, and what the customer needs. Thus, a customer 
journey can help a brand anticipate customer needs to create meaningful cus-
tomer  experiences:  for  the  brand  itself  and  its  websites,  digital  experiences, 
in-store experiences, and content. Customer journeys enable brands to create 
experiences that reflect an understanding of customers and their needs. From 
the inception of the brand strategy through to the content to support it, cus-
tomer journeys provide a tool to get everything that a brand needs to under-
stand (correctly) about the customer. 

Gartner  conducts  extensive  research  in  customer  experience  return  on 
investment (ROI) and recently concluded that customer-centric companies are 
60%  more  profitable  than  companies  that  are  not.  A  2019  report  found  that 
“CX [customer experience] drives over two-thirds of customer loyalty, outper-
forming  brand  and  price  combined”  (Gartner,  2019). The  same  report  notes 
that  to  improve  customer  experience,  “analyzing  customers’  salient  experi-
ences and [customer] journeys often illuminates numerous suboptimal touch-
points that contribute to customers’ overall [negative] perceptions” (Gartner, 
2019).  Several  recent  research  reports—including  from  McKinsey  (Diebner  
et al., 2021), Forrester (and Sirius Decisions) (Forrester, 2021), Harvard Busi-
ness Review (Gruner, 2021), and Forbes (Jenkins, 2021)—suggest the efficacy 
and necessity of customer journeys.

In order to put these concepts in context, Figure 5.2 shows a typical journey.
You need not understand the intricacies of the map illustrated in Figure 5.2. It 
presents a simple customer journey map, of which a typical printout from a plotter 
machine can wrap around the walls of a corner office in a skyscraper building. But 
let us unpack the illustration for a moment. The stages (columns) present the “life 
cycle” of the customer—that is, their entire relationship with a particular brand. 
Each stage presents unique opportunities for the brand to build and/or evolve its 
relationship with the customer through delivering specific types of content:

• Awareness. When a potential customer first becomes informed about the 

brand.

• Consideration. When the potential customer ponders whether they should 

engage with the brand.

• Decisions  (also  known  as  conversion).  When  the  potential  customer 

becomes an actual customer.

• Delivery and use. When the customer receives the product or service and 
uses it; sometimes this phase bifurcates into another called “Support,” which 
refers to when the customer requires assistance for the product (needing to 
call customer service, for instance).

• Loyalty and advocacy. “Loyalty” refers to when the customer comes back to 
the brand to reengage, and “advocacy” refers to when the customer evange-
lizes the brand (for example, by sharing their experience on social media).

80  Content Operations from Start to Scale

We often see these phases in a closed-loop diagram, where cross-selling and 
upselling, along with repurchasing, are factors that bridge the gap between loy-
alty and reengagement. In fact, McKinsey developed a model centered on the 
cyclical nature of customer interaction, called the “customer decision journey” 
model (Court et al., 2009).

The high-level paradigms presented in Figure 5.2 accommodate typical cus-
tomer behavior. Most customer relationships with a brand have these high-level 
phases in some form or another. For this chapter, I will focus on the follow-
ing stages: Perception (Awareness), Consideration, Conversion, Use, Loyalty, 
Advocacy, and Reengagement.

Each customer’s journey with a brand is different, and every customer has a  
unique journey in how they engage with a brand. Further, the activities that  
a customer completes in each of these phases, or “micro-journeys” within each 
phase, differ radically, depending on the industry type and customer type. That 
is why the second type of journey that we need to consider is a more specific 
customer journey within the larger map, based on prioritized tasks like “down-
load a whitepaper,” “fill out a form,” “return a gift,” and so on. These more task-
based customer journeys allow us to map content to specific customer tasks, 
touchpoints, and areas within a web page or printed page. 

In customer experience, marketing and digital, we can segment certain types 
of customers based on behavioral conditions. To do so, we leverage quantitative 
and  qualitative  customer  data  and  customer  insights  from  analytics,  consumer 
research, and user testing to create a picture of the customer profile or type. We 
create what we call segmentation models and personae. A persona represents 
an archetype of a customer based on shared behaviors. Without getting into too 
much detail, a “Soccer Parent” or “Digital Native” might represent typical perso-
nae used by a retail company to cluster a group of like-minded customers. We can 
then design journeys specifically for these customers and their behavioral profiles. 
You might ask why we would do so, but consider for a moment the needs of a 
“Silver Surfer Adventurer’’ persona (defined as a retired seventy-year-old man 
who travels the world) purchasing different types of insurance versus those of 
a “Social Justice Advocate Digital Native” persona (defined as a thirty-year-old 
millennial trans person living in Denver, Colorado). And think about not only 
the products and services offered to them but how a US-based global insurance 
brand such as Safety Insurance would position its company, products, and ser-
vices to those two customer types. 

We design journeys specifically for personas or customer types. It is impor-
tant to note here that we also create personae or profiles for our primary and 
secondary  customer  bases  and  for  customers  whom  we  would  like  to  target 
(and may not be reaching). Generally, I recommend no more than five to seven 
personae or profiles so that a ContentOps team can limit these to key customer 
bases, which allows the team to prioritize decisions and think through strategy 
for the most significant audiences.

Customer Experience and Content Operations  81

Content and Customer Journey

Now,  let  us  return  to  those  high-level  phases,  as  these  form  the  foundations 
of effective content messaging within customer  experience—and,  as  a  result, 
effective  ContentOps  workflows.  We  will  explore  them  from  a  foundational 
perspective: what a brand must achieve to build its relationship with the cus-
tomer within each phase.

• Perception (Awareness). Identifies the stage at which the prospective cus-
tomer is entirely unaware of a brand and its service or offerings. Brands use 
advertising and marketing content to build initial awareness of their ser-
vices or products for prospective customers (and to highlight new oppor-
tunities and cross-sell paths for existing customers). A brand has little time 
to gain the attention of prospective customers: it takes a customer “10 sec-
onds or less” (Court et al., 2009) to form an impression of an organization 
through branded content. Therefore, competitively differentiated, memora-
ble, and effective marketing messaging, and the most compelling “look and 
feel” to reach the right audiences, proves critical. (Think about that Super 
Bowl ad that you don’t forget the morning after the game.) 

• Consideration.  The  brand’s  content  manages  to  gain  the  customer’s  
attention and the customer wishes to evaluate the brand prior to purchase. 
This phase includes any of the following: in-store appraisal, research on a 
company’s  website,  competitive  analysis  (comparing  the  company  to  its 
competitors),  third-party  peer  reviews  (Yelp,  customer  reports,  and  so 
on),  and  validation  through  influencers,  social  media,  or  known  persons 
(friends/family). Product packaging, website content, social media content, 
and trained in-store staff (which means tight messaging, proof points, and 
talking points) remain crucial in this phase. Getting content right here is 
vitally important. Google’s own research confirms that “it takes .05 seconds 
for a visitor to form an opinion of a website” (Nunn, 2016). And the rule of 
seven typically applies to a customer prior to making a purchase, meaning 
that for B2B (business-to-business) and B2C (business to consumer) trans-
actions, “It takes an average of seven interactions with your brand before 
a purchase will take place” (Cairns, 2021, p. 150). This phase also carries 
implications for technical communication teams, as reports show that 53% 
of global customers use technical product information to learn more about 
a product before purchasing it (Cision, 2017).

• Conversion. The customer buys the product. Here, the point-of-sale (POS) 
interaction proves paramount, as does the engagement with the sales repre-
sentative and/or the delivery or courier service. Whether the delivery hap-
pens in one channel or in a multi- or omnichannel approach, the customer 
expects  a  seamless  experience.  Thus,  if  the  customer  orders  the  product 
online, they assume that they will be able to pick it up in store without issue. 

82  Content Operations from Start to Scale

All messaging and content supporting the conversion process remains criti-
cal,  because  the  customer  provides  money  for  the  product  and  expects  a 
certain level of service and guarantee. In many industries, customers trust 
that  their  privacy  will  be  preserved,  and  they  certainly  expect  that  their 
financial information will be protected. From the point of sale through the 
delivery  of  the  product,  all  communication  should  evoke  trust,  integrity, 
and  security.  All  content  and  branded  information  should  communicate 
this  fact.  Any  breakdown  here  can  create  an  irreparable  fissure  between 
customer and brand. Processes should be streamlined and optimized—you 
want  the  customer  to  convert  as  efficiently  as  possible—and  they  should 
observe  contemporary  trends  in  showing  respect  to  customers,  such  as 
offering contactless purchases in light of COVID-19 safety protocols. 

• Use. This phase constitutes the evaluation stage, or trial period, of a prod-
uct,  where  the  “proof  is  in  the  pudding.”  This  phase  becomes  the  nexus 
that solidifies (or breaks) customer trust. True, the product must stand the 
test of how the brand previously positioned it in the customer’s experience 
through its marketing and advertising content. Authenticity and true rep-
resentation of the product and its capabilities remain essential in effective 
brand building. But the product’s packaging, instructions, any content on 
the website meant to troubleshoot the use of the product, and/or the train-
ing for the in-store salesperson (or sales representative who may receive a 
call) must all support a positive customer experience in using the product. 
Here,  the  brand  should  include  consistent  messaging  on  how  to  use  the 
product  and  anticipate  any  customer  needs  regarding  the  product’s  use. 
This process also highlights the need for robust customer journey modeling 
at a more micro level to ascertain customer needs. Smart brands develop 
content to support the product and its use for the customer—and the peo-
ple  and  technologies  (e.g.,  chatbots)  required  to  support  that  product’s 
use—to ensure an exceptional customer experience. For medical products, 
clear and concise labeling that evokes safety, health, and care remains an 
essential component in ensuring customer trust. And even smarter brands 
anticipate  that  the  customer  will  appreciate  the  product  and  create  entry 
points for the next phase, loyalty and advocacy: loyalty through incentives 
to retain the customer, and advocacy through campaigns to inspire the cus-
tomer to share their experience with the product.

• Loyalty and Advocacy. I combine these two phases, but in actuality these 
denominators remain distinct, with loyalty pertaining to customer reten-
tion  and  advocacy  to  customer  influence.  Loyalty  is  the  ultimate  goal  of 
successful brand building, and advocacy is the cherry on top. Loyalty means 
that the customer remains faithful (although brands should not fall into the 
trap of hubris, as arrogance may lead to customer experience failures, yield-
ing customer attrition). The cost of losing a customer proves detrimental to 
brands and has been quantified by numerous studies. Customer deflection 

Customer Experience and Content Operations  83

metrics also contrast the cost of customer retention with that of acquiring 
new customers. There is no comparison: the general consensus is that for 
most industries, it costs five times as much to acquire as opposed to retain 
customers. Loyalty comes from satisfying customers with good customer 
experience, consistent brand messaging, reward programs (if these exist), 
and loyalty programs (if these exist). Advocacy derives from incentives to 
attract influencers, such as campaigns that encourage the customer to share 
their experiences with the product and make it easy for them to do so. Inter-
estingly, customers place the highest trust in referrals on brands from peo-
ple whom they know, and word of mouth marketing “drives $6 trillion of 
annual consumer spending, accounts for 13% of consumer sales, and peo-
ple are 90% more likely to trust and buy from a brand recommended by a 
friend” (Qualtrics, n.d.). Here is where positive customer experience at POS 
and in-store experiences provides critical touchpoints, as these customers 
remember human interactions more than they do digital ones. 

• Reengage. Many brands break down in this phase, but smart ones don’t. The 
primary  concern  here  revolves  around  replicating  the  triggers  that  drove 
the customer to purchase. An additional task is appealing to any brand loy-
alty that exists from previous engagement. 

At this point, you should have a basic understanding of the customer journey 
and its role in customer experience. So what does this mean for content and 
Content Operations? Customer journeys allow brands to consider each stage 
of their customers’ interactions—brands typically create a few journeys for five 
to  seven  personae—to  ensure  that  the  brand  has  the  content  and  messaging 
that speak to customers’ needs in each journey stage. Brands can leverage each 
stage in developing every aspect of their identity and messaging in a customer-
centric manner for brand identity content (logo, visual look and feel), market-
ing messaging, content that positions and supports the products, and the like.
This process also includes programs that the brand develops to meet custom-
ers’ needs throughout all of its service-delivering channels. Customer journeys 
can help identify customer touchpoints and help brands determine what content 
or interactions customers need in which channels (for instance, web, mobile, or 
in-store). Because customer journey maps consider the entire customer life cycle, 
they help to establish a way for content to meet the customer throughout that life 
cycle. Thus, the brand considers every stage of the journey when building out its 
identity in order to meet the customer where they are and where they need to go. 
Micro-journeys,  or  task-based  journeys,  help  a  brand  figure  out  content 
across channels and across more micro-steps. These journeys can help brands 
identify more specific content. We use content journey maps to identify content 
at the content type level. In “Content Type,” Jonathon Colman defines a content 
type as “a specification for a structured, standardized, reusable, and mutually 
exclusive kind of information entity” (2014, p. 48). Examples include thought

leadership white papers, event pages (for a conference), a website home page, 
and a frequently asked questions (FAQ) page. A task-based customer journey 
allows an organization to map content at a more structured level; we can actu-
ally map content to specific elements within a content type—for example, to a 
hero space within a website. Figure 5.3 shows an example.

In Figure 5.3’s example, you can see how content is mapped to specific areas 
within a website. This exercise illustrates the need for a structured content solu-
tion to support such a model. Within content management, structured content 
design is a method for architecting and conceiving content. 

This concept is critical for effective content management. Best practices for 
structured content design always start with defining a core set of content types 
that the content experience requires. Defining content types results in require-
ments and specifications for all content entities within a content management 
system (CMS). The content type defines the structure for a template, page type, 
or  container  of  content.  The  content  type  should  describe  the  intent  of  the 
information. By defining content based on its type, an organization can obtain 
several benefits, including the following: 

• Improve user experience (UX) to help users find the content that they need 
more quickly through consistent categorization and search functionality.
• Deliver consistency of structure, message, voice, and style within content 

type.

• Align content types to products at introduction and customer journey stage.
• Reduce/eliminate time spent doing “governing” work on what content types 

are used (and when, where, and how).

Customer Experience and Content Operations  85

• Provide guidance for content creators with specific content types and struc-

ture, thus eliminating ambiguity.

• Lay the foundation for advanced UX, utilizing machine learning/artificial 
intelligence, A/B versioning, personalization, and omnichannel interaction 
to support business goals, such as increased cross-sell/upsell or other mar-
keting and sales goals.

• Create  clean  user  analytics  that  can  identify  content  areas  to  focus  on, 

expand, or remove as well as highlight investment areas.

All  these  benefits  prove  relevant  when  considering  the  customer  journey. 
Once  a  content  type  is  defined,  it  becomes  the  basis  for  determining  which 
templates or structures are required to support it. A structure comprises the 
building blocks of a content type, and a content type template will break down 
into modules that may or may not be called components. Some content man-
agement systems brand this terminology differently, but think of it this way: 
a home page is a content type, which could also be a template. Within a web-
site’s home page, you might have hero space (component or module), featured 
products (component), news and events (component), a featured story (com-
ponent), and other content. 

Now let’s get back to that customer journey. As you can see in Figure 5.3, a task-
based customer journey allows you to map content to a journey. Thus, having a 
solution in place for creation, publication, and delivery of that content remains 
critical if one wishes to support an optimized customer experience. This means 
placing the customer journey as a primary requirement within ContentOps and, 
equally  important,  technical  stack  requirements.  To  do  this,  an  organization 
must have a customer journey in place, and it should also have a plan to map 
content for priority tasks (micro-journeys) within it—or already have done so. 

Considerations for Omnichannel within Customer Journeys

For  omnichannel  experiences,  customer  journeys  become  even  more  critical—
and present even more complexity with content solutions—because of the amount 
of  integration  involved  with  strategy,  content,  and  technologies.  If  we  consider 
even a typical number of channels within the omnichannel customer experience, 
we can see why: websites, mobile apps, kiosks, in-store interactions, POS interac-
tions, customer sales representatives, customer support representatives, print (e.g., 
packaging, manuals, brochures, or correspondence), events, radio, television, and 
digital signage. An omnichannel approach includes a business strategy that con-
siders the customer in all of the brand’s touchpoints and seeks to deliver content 
and services to that customer regardless of where they are within a journey.

Omnichannel  strategy  includes  an  approach  to  deliver  content  to  several 
of  the  above  channels,  but  it  optimizes  that  content  to  what  the  customer 
needs within that channel based on their interactions. Some key concepts that 

86  Content Operations from Start to Scale

omnichannel emphasizes include a single view of the customer, or the under-
standing of that customer regardless of which touchpoint is leveraged, and inte-
grated product inventory, which allows for a product to be ordered online and 
picked up in store. It also includes transparency in ordering and procurement 
for the customer. 

Insofar  as  content  is  concerned,  an  omnichannel  approach  requires  cross- 
channel analytics collection and cross-channel content publishing. This integra-
tion  may  include  integrating  an  email  system,  website,  and  customer  support 
center so that the organization understands what a customer has done and is able 
to respond to their actions in real time. A robust omnichannel model requires 
significant investment by an organization as well as an enterprise approach to data 
and content management. It also requires advanced personalization capabilities 
to tailor very specific content to a customer based on much more than just what 
content they have viewed. This personalization should consider all stages of the 
customer journey, especially once the organization knows who that customer is. 
Although most businesses will not adopt a true omnichannel strategy (and they 
may not necessarily require one), many can take away lessons from an omnichan-
nel mindset, such as optimizing customer experience across the various stages of 
the customer journey by ensuring that there is enough content in each channel to 
support the needs and use cases necessitated by those touchpoints. 

Personalization and Customer Journeys

Personalization  refers  to  any  content  contextually  targeted  based  on  
the following:

who someone is,
where someone is,
what someone does,
when someone does it,
how someone does it, or
why someone does it.

Within  this  context,  localized  content  is  technically  personalized  content, 
because it is contextual to a user’s location (or language preference, regardless 
of  location).  Although  many  businesses  leverage  personalization  solely  after 
a user authenticates and then personalize content against the user’s profile or 
previous purchase patterns, there is also much benefit to other forms of per-
sonalization. For example, if someone shows an interest in a particular industry 
vertical or product, showcasing content relevant to that topic can offer more 
tailored content to what the user seeks—even if that user remains unknown or 
unauthenticated. Other tactics include the following: 

Customer Experience and Content Operations  87

• Personalization based on key terms searched (if you know the user is inter-

ested in a particular topic).

• Cross-selling and upselling based on product views or previously purchased 

products.

• Recommended content based on the click-stream of content topics viewed.
• Content based on the company or organization where the user is located—

triggered by geolocation based on Internet Protocol (IP) address.

• Specific promotions based on geographical location or region.
• Targeted content based on paid media that the user clicked on or an email 
message that they opened to get to the website. (Note: advanced personali-
zation can also change the content in email prior to the user’s opening it, 
based on user behavior on a website or other channels.)

• Content  that  pushes  the  customer  from  one  stage  of  the  journey  to  

the next.

Today,  most  major brands offer some form of  personalization  on the  con-
sumer and B2B websites. Done well, it can yield all sorts of benefits. McKinsey  
reports  on  these  (Lindecrantz  et  al.,  2020).  This  report  notes  that  80%  of  
customers want personalization from retailers (but only if it is done well and 
provides relevant experiences) and that it can yield 20% higher customer sat-
isfaction rates. The report provides many more useful statistics as well as key 
considerations  when  thinking  about  first-time  business  personalization.  For 
B2B  considerations,  the  2020  B2B  Buyer  Behavior  Study  from  Demand  Gen 
(Demand Gen Report, n.d.) offers some of the following conclusions:

• 76% of those surveyed expect personalized content specific to their needs.
• 70% stated that it was very important to view “relevant content that speaks 

directly to our company.” 

• 96% wanted content that “spoke directly to our industry needs.”

Study after study has quantified the value of personalization for businesses, 
whether through an Account-Based Marketing model for the B2B or a targeted 
campaign for a retail customer. It can also be an important part of a business 
strategy to acquire new customers and drive efforts such as gated content strat-
egies and lead qualification for prospective customers. Customer journeys play 
a primary role in driving effective personalized content experiences.

Content Operations and Customer Journeys

All of the above indicates that customer journeys present many key areas of con-
sideration for ContentOps. A customer journey should inform requirements in 
the design of the following areas of ContentOps and operations models.

88  Content Operations from Start to Scale

• The enterprise content strategy/platform-specific content strategies. Use 
customer journeys as a key input to inform strategic decisions and priori-
ties around content objectives, internal operations objectives, and perfor-
mance objectives.

• Content life cycles and workflows. Look to design workflows that will sup-
port the various aspects of cross-channel customer journeys. Use customer 
journey maps to define the workflow at the content type level. 

• Content  structure.  Use  task-based  customer  journey  maps  as  a  primary 
input into the design decisions and rules for how content modules or com-
ponents are used or reused across platforms.

• Content governance. Leverage customer journeys as a process and primary 
input within the governance model; ensure representation within the gov-
ernance structure of the journey.

• Content  technology  requirements.  Use  both  customer  maps  and  task- 
based  customer  journeys  to  define  detailed  requirements  for  technology 
stacks. Customer journey maps can identify points of system integration, as 
can cross-channel task-based maps. 

The  above  considerations  provide  a  blueprint  for  how  and  where  customer 
journeys plug into ContentOps modeling and thinking. 

Content’s Role in Quantifying Customer Experience

Customer journeys can help identify which content to consider in a given trans-
action. This puts content in the role of having the ability to improve or move the 
needle on customer experience. An optimized ContentOps team and model, 
one that demonstrates improved content, can then improve the customer expe-
rience. These points are important; a ContentOps team should think about how 
it can implement ways to measure this impact. Content remains a valuable tool 
to quantify customer experience, which adds to its value as a business asset. 
A  ContentOps  workflow  should  look  at  the  customer  journey  with  the  cus-
tomer experience team and define a metrics approach that demonstrates the 
role that content plays in customer experience performance. By demonstrating 
this impact—and then cross-referencing these metrics with internal operations 
metrics, such as cost to produce content—a ContentOps team can demonstrate 
how content proves its worth as an asset within customer experience.

Conclusion

This  chapter  has  made  the  case  for  customer  journeys,  demonstrated  the  
components  that  make  up  customer  journeys,  and  explained  specific  use 

Customer Experience and Content Operations  89

cases. A solid understanding of each of these areas is critical in understanding 
the roles that customer journeys play in regard to content. This understand-
ing  provides  the  foundations  for  recognizing  where  customer  journeys  plug  
into  ContentOps.  Effectively  leveraging  customer  journeys  will  position  a  
ContentOps model for success in any organization. Tying ContentOps to cus-
tomer experience strategically can also help elevate the role and importance of 
ContentOps within organizations.

Customer journeys require complicated content solutions. A solid and firm 
operating model for content production—and ContentOps team—is essential 
for the optimal performance of a journey.

Personalization and Content Operations

Jeffrey MacIntyre 

Personalized  experience  is  a  uniquely  vexing  topic  in  technology  and  
design  circles.  It’s  simultaneously  a  paradisal  and  dystopian  scenario  among 
consumers—and a variously utopian or fraught one among practitioners who 
manage them. Who could forget the Amazon chestnut that 35% of total reve-
nues derive from its recommendations feature set, or the moment when Netflix 
navigation and browse features went fully algorithmic (bye bye, default state!), 
or when Spotify’s Discover Weekly playlists started to make waves?

Fewer know that Spotify did this quietly, on the back of a metadata engine 
acquisition, to “smarten” how it curated its content catalog. “Information Archi-
tecture (IA) before Artificial Intelligence (AI)” is more than a catchy slogan: it 
aptly describes the role of structured content and data in the destiny of every 
connected experience. Amid the polarized perceptions that it is either magical 
or malicious, designing for personalization is also the source of considerable 
reward in business: the results, when realized, can be sizable, and the attribu-
tion to content’s performance and design decisions quite clear. The enduring 
arguments for a connected experience run something as presented in Table 6.1.

Sounds dreamy, right?
There is a personalization gap that clouds the clarity that we would expect, 
however, twenty-plus years into the history of the web, and it’s the sum of all fears 
and fantasies that this technology tends to evoke, particularly for those who see 
it as more the province of high-powered, digital-by-default organizations than

ones  like  their  own.  Put  simply,  the  refrain  goes  something  like  this:  “We’re 
not Amazon, and we’ll never be.” Like any pernicious framing, it’s not entirely 
untrue. But the personalization gap has disadvantaged many from succeeding 
in their journey to increased customer-centricity.

Simplified  customer  experiences  dominate  in  businesses  of  every  type  as 
a  leading  source  of  aspirational  competitive  advantage.  Scale  and  systema-
tization are key to the thrust of ContentOps, so questions of automation or 
personalization  are  never  far  off.  ContentOps  has  both  a  role  and  a  reward 
in significantly advancing the state of practice here—and in time, folks may 
rightly  see  connected  experiences  as  the  natural  fruit  of  a  strong  Content  
Ops function.

The ContentOps Advantage

The essential riddle that has bewitched countless product, content, and infor-
mation professionals pursuing how to design and deliver personalized expe-
riences  can  be  summarized  by  a  quip  often  attributed  to  children’s  author 
Theodor  Geisel:  “Sometimes  the  questions  are  complicated  and  the  answers  
are simple.”

The right content to the right person at the right time is the end goal that we 
all know, and it’s a commonplace for content professionals—even those operat-
ing in the default state of a user interface, absent any personalized tweaks. Yet 
as any digital professional worth their salt also knows, delivering on “simple” is 
a remarkable skill and an all-too-rare feat achieved in our projects. Accenture 
calls personalization the challenge of how “to uniquely serve everyone without 
overwhelming anyone” (Accenture Interactive, 2018, p. 2) in its customary set-
ting: a digital interface. This represents a massive reverse-zoom from the expe-
rience  of  humans  navigating  50,000-square-foot  shopping  experiences  with 
100,000 products merchandised physically to a 4-inch black rectangular screen 
regaling us with 10 million items to be digitally discovered.

Getting  to  “simple”  for  users  is  anything  but.  The  trick  is  working  with  
the  grammar  of  personalization—the  who,  what,  when,  where,  and  how 

Personalization and Content Operations  93

parameters  that  fire  every  given  interaction  that  you  personalize,  customize, 
or  automate—to  bend  the  complex  to  the  clear  and  confidently  narrow  end 
users’ choices from bewildering to cohesive. The complication lies in wrestling 
content, audience, and context into a meaningfully generalizable set of entities 
that can work satisfactorily and consistently.

The good news? The complexity quarterback we’re talking about sounds a lot 

like you.

Designing for personalization rewards a close, root understanding of one’s 
content offering, life cycle, and mechanics. Systems whisperers are just the right 
kind of folks for this simplification request. User interactions depend upon the 
coordination, if not outright orchestration, of multiple systems of record: con-
tent management system (CMS), digital asset management (DAM), customer 
data platform (CDP), product information management (PIM), and marketing 
automation platform (MAP), to name a few of the familiar tech-stack suspects. 
All connected experiences demand an IA-before-AI foundation to ensure the 
reliable  flow  and  understanding  of  data  and  information.  In  capable  hands, 
ContentOps is the stewardship of this information layer.

A ContentOps outlook provides precisely the preconditions, sensibility, and 
tools necessary for closing the personalization gap and realizing these simpli-
fied experiences as more likely outcomes in your own projects. For this reason, 
we fully expect in coming years to see more ContentOps practitioners recog-
nized as leading lights of the nascent personalization field of practice.

Closing the Personalization Gap

Step zero in achieving personalization success requires understanding the out-
sized role that failure plays in our understanding of what has not worked. For 
years  now,  it  has  been  customary  to  see  the  fortunes  of  personalization  wax 
and  wane,  going  from  glitter  to  gauche.  Many  product  pros,  particularly  in 
Silicon Valley, sing its praises; just as many design folks, especially strategists 
and  content management wonks, are quick to call out personalization as an in-
practice disappointment.

For content marketing consultant Robert Rose, personalization is “the sexi-
est thing no one is doing yet.” Its effects are generally approved by consumers, 
results are roundly appreciated by organizations, its rank as a business priority 
remains high—and for all that, the mechanics of execution remain a conten-
tious issue in practice.

Information management professionals, from the dawn of digital to today, 
have  said  that  single  sourcing  is  the  path  to  liberating  a  content  offering  for 
personalized, customized, or automated expression. If we create well-defined 
atomic units of content, we can trace and maximize their reuse. This somewhat 
utopian project confounds many efforts to scale personalization.

94  Content Operations from Start to Scale

Before  we  explore  why  the  Edenic  model  and  its  totalizing  logic—“it’s  not 
personalization unless we personalize all the things”—undermines such efforts, 
consider also the consumer and business backdrop.

For  the  longest  time,  software  vendors  have  steadily  touted  the  seemingly 
ongoing  arrival  of  personalization  at  scale.  Vendors  in  the  CMS,  MAP,  and 
personalization engine categories have been relentless in expressing connected 
experience as the next logical evolution in experience design. At the same time, 
different digital professional focus areas from content, to data, to product have 
taken varied approaches in their contributions to personalized customer expe-
rience  (CX).  Content  subject  matter  experts  (SMEs)  are  wont  to  talk  about 
componentization, the modeling of content assets into modular chunks. Data 
SMEs  may  be  more  inclined  to  involve  testing  and  experimentation  gener-
ally in the world of experience optimization. Product SMEs, by comparison, 
may take a more functional-level and feature-engineering approach, providing  
particular  tactical  automations,  customizations,  or  personalizations  in  their 
products. The thinking here has been divergent for years, and because the soft-
ware market is similarly fragmentary and aimed toward these functional audi-
ences, it’s unsurprising that a holistic playbook for broad-based personalization 
has eluded us.

Who are the poster children for connected experience? It is indeed easy to 
gesture at MAANA companies (Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, Netflix, Apple) and 
proclaim that we are a full generation into users who are broadly habituated 
to the algorithmic age of user experience. It is similarly easy to point out the 
many shortcomings of connected experiences, especially in black-box machine 
learning techniques that generate AI that is unexplainable, and unaccountable, 
to civil society. Long-standing issues of overfitting and overdetermined target-
ing dog our day-to-day interactions online, and stories of “perso-fails” firing off 
overzealous notifications are a kind of ongoing punchline. A growing aware-
ness of the distortions of algorithmically defined settings and interaction pat-
terns dominates the news.

Personalization is so synonymous with both prize and peril in digital circles 
that it has become in recent years a reliable marker of deeply unfashionable, 
starry-eyed  tech  optimism.  Personalization,  in  this  context,  is  invoked  more 
as a joke about green practitioners who have yet to be roughed up by a tour 
of duty on their own failed perso project with a gaudy technology that cannot 
deliver even limited returns on the good-as-DOA pledge of the right content to 
the right person at the right time.

The cognoscenti aren’t generally wrong about the hazards of personalization 
efforts,  but  they’re  often  hostage  to  a  glib  disregard  for  significant  advances 
in  technology  and  business  practice  that  mean  fewer  people  make  the  same 
mistakes any longer. For content subject matter experts, in particular, there is 
a sunny future ahead and it starts with the tool kit that they bring to the table.
Why haven’t we had this conversation to properly size up this opportunity?

Personalization and Content Operations  95

Personalization is a broader mosaic of various  expressions of  digital  inter-
actions:  websites,  apps,  notifications,  product  and  content  recommenders, 
 multichannel  communications  like  email-based  nurture  campaigns  or  SMS-
sent automations, conversational user interfaces, and complex sets of rules and 
algorithms—and data management tools, too. Across all of this, we’ve lacked 
the  ability  to  develop  a  framework  to  design  holistically  for  personalized 
exper ience. What pockets of SME practice do exist can largely be found in the 
domains of specific software categories, like content management, taxonomy 
and  metadata  management,  analytics,  experience  optimization,  content  and 
product recommendations, and marketing automation.

What’s more, the draw to personalization has become better appreciated in  
the  broader  context  of  product  differentiation,  information  overload,  and 
increasingly clear data about consumer preferences for simplified, streamlined 
customer experiences. For example, the analyst firm Gartner managed to set off 
a tempest in a teacup for the technology-obsessive when it recently proclaimed 
that  some  80%  of  organizations  aspiring  to  personalized  customer  experi-
ences  will  falter  and  eventually  abandon  them  altogether  (Gartner,  2019).  A 
fine scaremongering tactic, but it does helpfully remind us that a personaliza-
tion gap remains when it comes to our professional acumen and our practices. 
Meanwhile, user experience (UX) practitioners have been particularly lagging 
behind their peers in marketing and analytics as to the art of the possible. The 
design  of  personalized  experiences  and  the  advance  of  a  conversation  about 
design’s role in personalization effectiveness have likely suffered as a result.

Gartner didn’t come to bury personalization: it came to pronounce magical 
thinking  dead.  “Big  bang”  or  moonshot  personalization  doesn’t  work  in  any 
organization,  no  matter  how  personalization-curious  it  may  be.  It  is  simply 
impossible  in  the  face  of  existing  experience  and  metadata  debt  common  to 
most companies. I’m fond of a question a consultancy in this space once used 
to gauge the sprawling power of personalization and optimization software: If 
you can do anything (and you can), how then do you decide to focus your time 
and efforts?

The  quintessential  problem  of  personalization  is  that  the  software  so  
surpasses  the  available  talent  and  experience  in  wielding  it  effectively  and  
efficiently.  Meanwhile,  personalized  features  and  functionality  have  sneak-
thieved  their  way  into  all  kinds  of  software  and  design  practices,  with  novel 
digital  interfaces  replacing  their  customary  human  originals.  Designing  for 
them may be exotic to you, but connected experiences are fast encroaching into 
the lives of everyday people. Consider the prosaic fast-food restaurant visit: at 
a bare minimum, the McDonald’s restaurant connected experience spans IBM 
Watson  AI  voice  interface  at  the  drive-through,  a  Dynamic  Yield–powered 
dynamic menu and kiosk system, and a loyalty software responsible for doling 
out appropriate deals both pre- and post-order and, conceivably, pricing in its 
mobile app.

The  personalization  gap  is  not  about  technological  shortcomings.  It  is  not 
about talent, though it is (anecdotally speaking) unmistakably affected by rela-
tive inexperience among many people confronted with personalization projects. 
The personalization gap is the unserious conversation among digital profession-
als that misses the critical contribution that design offers, and that students of 
ContentOps can utilize, as a remedy to all this confounding complexity.

Progressive Personalization, a Playbook  
for Connected Experience

The world is noisy. Navigating it is tiring at times—and uniquely taxing in the 
information-dense world of digital products and services. The UX world has 
long maintained that better design and technology create a balm for the digital 
disorder in our daily lives, with personalization heralding a glorious advance: a 
way of radically simplifying and calming our user interfaces and screens while 
improving their effectiveness.

We  have  been  doing  personalization  wrong,  particularly  in  the  crusading 
focus on totalizing, moonshot-or-bust end states that are rarely practical, effi-
cient, or sustainable. Given the success of the MAANA giants, it’s easy to paint 
personalization approaches as out of touch with the Main Street business world 
or the needs of governments or nonprofits. The real-world line on personaliza-
tion is that it requires too much and that risks exceed rewards. Enthusiasts of 
personalization  technology  and  applications  come  off  as  impractical  at  best, 
and at worst, out of touch.

Maybe both parties are exactly right.
Personalization needs a practical, pragmatic basis in order to be successful 
in business settings where we haven’t even mastered our own content manage-
ment and marketing technologies. And the fanciest design system is coming 
up  short  if  it  can’t  create  a  vernacular  for  how  content  is  being  contextually 
delivered based on different heuristics and semantics.

In short, getting to the essence matters. That takes a few forms.

1.  IA before AI is axiomatic. The best algorithms arise from a foundational 
architecture of data and content, and personalization has a clear grammar. 
(The  clearest  “perso-fails”  erupt  when  IA  is  not  in  the  loop,  as  we’ll  see 
later.) Understand the map of the constituent components of your digi-
tal footprint across channels, like web and email and kiosks, and across 
end points, like websites and apps. Understand how content and data flow 
across them. Content must be componentized—but don’t go overboard. 
There are on-ramps that can train your organization in what level of com-
ponentization is ripe for strategic opportunity.

2.  A  jobs-to-be-done  or  top-tasks  paradigm  will  help  bring  added  focus 
to one, or maybe two at most, goals for a given screen. How will a user 

Personalization and Content Operations  97

progress  in  an  interaction  flow  that  is  itself  seated  in  a  wider  customer 
journey? The definition and fidelity of these understandings are crucial, 
illuminating what gets personalized and when.

3.  A culture of experimentation is unquestionably helpful. Testing and opti-
mization  are  fundamental  to  successful  personalization  programs.  They 
are also proving grounds for teams able to make rapid, ongoing changes 
to core content and any given interactions in the digital footprint. Nimble 
teams win at so much in digital, even scale plays.

There  are  whole  pre-personalization  projects  that  some  organizations  
undertake  here  to  ensure  some  base  readiness.  Many  never  evolve  beyond 
them.  Truthfully,  their  value  to  an  organization  that,  say,  implements  a  per-
sonalization engine is that the above work can guide an approach to using the 
software’s  features  and  functionality  to  simplify  the  customer  experience  (as 
opposed to only complicating your administration of it). The signature feature 
of every personalization software suite is its sheer potency—the innumerable 
interventions possible.

But there is a root grammar to all personalizations and automations and cus-
tomizations that is good to remember: a what, a who, a when, a where, a how, 
and … yes, a why. User interfaces usually state these as strings: “I want to do X, 
at the time of Y, for Z users, using these specific content elements.” 

These parameters form the basis for everything done, and so it makes sense 
that the components of your IA form the direct basis of your “where” (e.g., place-
ments of a component on a given page template). The “who” are audiences that 
you already know and track. The “when” maps to discrete moments or interac-
tions patterns in user flows, nested within a customer journey. The “how” will 
vary based on one’s setting, but, broadly speaking, it includes dynamic content 
elements (pop-ups, in-line messages, ribbons, call-outs, or outright component 
swap-outs), recommenders, automations and campaigns, notifications, conver-
sational user interfaces, and even customizations (i.e., user preference settings).

Consider how Slack messaging software instructs itself on whether you want 

to be notified of something in their product (Figure 6.1).

Sound  overwhelming?  In  the  absence  of  guiding  artifacts,  it  absolutely  is. 
Even with them, it can still be more than a little paralyzing. These are conse-
quential decisions.

Designing for contextual content delivery is unlike designing for the default 
state, and so it comes with additional overhead and practical consequences for 
experienced owners. Hick’s Law holds that a user’s decision-making time lags 
in proportion to the number of choices presented to that user (Soegaard, 2021). 
Adherence  to  a  clear  and  consistent  vernacular  in  personalization  practices 
goes a long way toward more stable and preferable outcomes. The more gener-
alizable the building blocks of your customer experience, the easier it becomes 
to mold and transform it in a way that you can measure and appreciate its per-
formance with end users—and for your organizational leadership.

Personalization and Content Operations  99

If you experience your own choice fatigue about what automations to run, 
say, it may be a fair indicator that the building blocks you work with are too 
detailed and specific. Try moving up the ladder to a higher-order generaliza-
tion. Too many audience segments to juggle? Find parent categories. Too many 
page  components  in  play?  Only  target  header  components.  Certainly,  avoid 
creating new classes and segments and interaction patterns that are not already 
part  of  how  you  manage  and  express  your  digital  experience.  Designing  for 
connected experiences should be about selectivity, although it becomes impor-
tant to be able to define for breadth in creating effects at levels that become sta-
tistically significant. If you are having trouble measuring the impact of changes 
to a single page, reconsider the number of pages in which you may be able to 
apply the tactic to reach the goal metric sooner.

That said, progressive personalization is a perspective of getting to early value 
in a connected experience, and sometimes the guiding light to sponsoring, say, 
a more in-depth customer journey assessment, or a “just-enough-taxonomy” 
metadata  enrichment  activity,  or  selecting  and  implementing  a  marketing 
automation  platform,  is  itself  a  proto-personalization  project.  In  progressive 
personalization, there are three classic on-ramps to connected experience, and 
success in one or more of them typically drives the sponsorship of increased 
investment  and  rigor  in  that  connected  experience.  These  on-ramps  are  
only  sequential  in  terms  of  relative  time  and  resource  investment,  but  they  
are  standalone  projects:  the  third  on-ramp  does  not  require  completing  the 
first and second, for example. They also encourage learning the ropes of one 
of  three  different  experience  modes  of  a  connected  experience:  automation, 
customization, and personalization. This is noteworthy, since one mode may 
be wholly appropriate and others not, depending on the type of “smarts” that 
an organization is seeking to bring to their CX, or the type of hypothesis being 
tested. From the musical-motif names I’ve given them, it should be clear that 
they entail an increased level of committed initial and even ongoing effort—
and that they involve increasing levels of sophistication around orchestration 
of content and data, too.

The Solo

This project finds you automating a key moment in the customer journey, sys-
tematizing it as an email-based set of interactions. This can be pulled off with a 
variety of freemium to enterprise email software, effectively requiring the abil-
ity to create an email drip campaign or series of automations. If engagement via 
this channel performs well, consider this a signal to expand utilization to other 
key moments to be delivered via the push mechanics of email or messaging, as 
appropriate. In terms of key performance indicators (KPIs), this is intended to 
drive journey progression, increase marketing qualified leads (MQLs), reduce 
churn, and increase reach.

100  Content Operations from Start to Scale

In one instance, a software as a service (SaaS) client took initial steps to build-
ing  out  their  marketing  automation  through  this  on-ramp. They  identified  a 
few select moments in their customer journey (a welcome flow, a nurture flow, 
and a “wingback” flow), creating email campaigns to automate those activities 
that were otherwise actions only available on their website or (at times) web 
app. The operative shift here was that this was a push mechanism rather than 
one  that  depended  on  continued  user  engagement  and  interest.  In  addition, 
the campaigns were automated as statistically relevant results confirmed their 
effectiveness. This implementation created a foundation for their future mar-
keting team to run with—and paid off the entire automation project budget by 
setting up just one automation, to circle back via email with those whose credit 
card purchases were somehow interrupted.

The Sonata

This is the least effortful of the on-ramps from execution and technology stand-
points. The CX specialist will clone a page (or stack of grouped pages) and then 
de- and reconstruct their content to appeal to a narrower audience. This could 
be as simple as copying an existing landing page and then rewriting and styling 
it for a specific customer segment. The notion here is to explore in a split test 
how the two (the as-is and the customized page[s]) perform. Does targeted con-
tent and messaging improve conversion rate among the target audience? This 
approach can be undertaken in the context of a broader Account-Based Market-
ing (ABM) effort or any other customer-centric movement in an organization. 
It will be important to make search engine optimization accommodations for 
this approach, and similarly, one will need to be practical about what this would 
take if scaled up as a segmented experience beyond a single cluster of pages. The 
sonata  on-ramp  is  designed  to  reward  those  who  are  more  conservative  and 
may want to entertain various hypotheses about audience segmentation without 
going deeper into specialized software, cookie dependencies, or other aspects of 
full-on personalization.

For  KPIs,  it  is  intended  to  increase  segmentation,  lift  conversion  rate,  and 

improve confidence in the quality and reliability of segment analytics.

The Symphony

The premise is to begin playing familiar compositions for your users, thereby 
authoring  your  organization’s  own  songbook  for  what,  and  for  whom,  it 
wants to drive attention to in its digital footprint. Here is where previously 
conducted user or heuristic research can shine, as it works best with inputs 
from a jobs-to-be-done (JTBD) or user-needs-focused cookbook of content 

Personalization and Content Operations  101

recommendations to be offered up in a given component of a certain screen 
or page of a key digital touchpoint. The idea is to provide a short list of links 
on a recurring, always-on basis to establish a baseline expectation for users of 
increasing interactivity and automation. It can be paired with Colin Eagan’s 
zoning approach (Eagan, 2019) to get effect, which will be discussed in detail 
later in this chapter.

It  does  not  absolutely  require  recommendations  functionality  or  a  recom-
mender software, although that would be a sound basis when scaling it. There 
are many open-source frameworks for recommenders, and they are generally 
built-in features to any personalization engine. They are also becoming avail-
able as add-ons in marketing automation platforms and some experience man-
agement systems.

For KPIs, the symphony is primarily a vehicle for driving engagement and 
customer satisfaction. It should also be considered a driver of curated traffic 
(in order to cross-promote more effectively, for example, which is a desirable 
by-product of this approach as it matures).

Some organizations find the on-ramps compelling as a way of focusing them-
selves on a clear return on investment (ROI). The best part about them is they 
don’t require expensive software investment and exotic acts of preexisting tech-
nology integration. They can be undertaken by small teams or even teams of 
one: an orchestrated experience with no need of an orchestra.

Taking a more culinary metaphor, by getting a handle on your perso-grammar, 
operators can focus on the ingredients in the snacks and staples they start whip-
ping up, whether in the “dream kitchen” of a personalization engine software, the 
cramped galley operation of one’s existing warts-and-all tech stack, or a more fleet, 
food-truck-like operation of a composable digital experience platform (DXP).

Design Is the Critical Gap in a Flawed Personalization Strategy

In  the  same  way  in  which  few  content  strategies  may  survive  without  dedi-
cated ContentOps resourcing, there is no personalization strategy worth its salt 
without input from a design viewpoint. We’re all orchestrators now, and unless 
you’re one of the fortunate few, you may be closer to jug band than symphony.
What’s more, a design viewpoint helps broaden the conversation to marketing 
technology and automation while underscoring the sometimes brute-force con-
tent work that can be entailed in more complex orchestrations. These on-ramps 
deliver interactions that are automated (whether through AI or business rules) 
as well as customized. Customization is an important flip side to the coin of per-
sonalization and a remedy for dark patterns of ethically questionable practices. 
Oftentimes customization is the best way to offer a more tailored experience to a 
user, by offering it up as a choice. Regressive personalization is where designers 
don’t offer a way out or an explanation for the tailored interaction.

102  Content Operations from Start to Scale

It’s worth mentioning that all personalization “fails” are failures of designing 
effectively with data. Regressive personalization needs a progressive rethink, a 
way to tiptoe into more potent, dynamic interactions.

The  personalization  technology  software  alone,  while  wondrous  and  often 
exceeding expectations, is not enough. What personalization needs to become 
a regularly successful practice, more than anything, is clear, rigorous, thought-
ful  design.  At  some  level,  for  most  organizations  this  will  mean  tending  to 
experience debt. This level of commitment may require revisiting a customer 
journey map. Judging by Colin Eagan’s breakthrough work, UX professionals 
with  content  subject  matter  expertise  are  especially  well  positioned  to  make 
outsize contributions to what design can bring to the delivery of more person-
alization success stories.

Designing a Clearer Commons

The zone-targeting model gives design and information architecture a proper 
seat at the table in the conversation around bettering personalization through 
design. The idea is simple enough, and its plainness is what makes it so self- 
evidently  good  and  durable:  take  your  personalization  program  and  dimen-
sionalize  it  across  the  key  real  estate  that  are  your  customer  touchpoints  
(websites, apps, interfaces, channels, and so on). Eagan’s innovation (2019) is to 
look at personalization like a zoning board looks at building out a civic space. 
Implicitly, this is sometimes contested corporate territory—or a commons that 
must be governed and managed.

The joy of the zone-targeting approach, which calls for a rational mapping 
that makes the business logic or algorithms explainable (and hence reproduci-
ble and measurable), is that it can start very small. It can be a matter of isolating 
a single design element on a single page template or examining how a custom 
field in an email is used.

Testing this approach is a matter of simply declaring objectives and a clear 
(and hopefully consistent) grammar for how to utilize the space with appropri-
ate messages for given audiences. Eagan built a telescope that is a microscope, 
too, and it works at every resolution if you are executing systematically with 
your personalization program.

The best first step is to get literal and structural and to begin divvying up key 
components  of  a  customer  experience. These  primitives  form  the  basis  for  a 
design element vernacular that will be automated, customized, or personalized.
Eagan’s zoning model takes the 4D hairiness of personalization and reduces 
it  to  a  2D  concept  of  real  estate  to  be  operated  and  maintained  according 
to its routine, governed use. There’s a lot of conceptual value in that kind of 
broad classification, and a real estate metaphor speaks especially to the cross-
functional challenges of governing corporate digital spaces. Bad UX too often

descends into particulars prior to understanding broader applications and des-
ignations of our digital interfaces.

See, for example, Eagan’s model (2019) of bucketing for “tasks at hand” versus 
“big picture” messaging in personalized settings. Whatever its uses, this method 
is also a canny way of smuggling in governance by principle and maybe institut-
ing conceptual headroom for organizations to be more measured and balanced 
in the type of messaging that they deliver as part of a personalized experience.

The Problem with Precision (and Precisionists)  
in Personalization Programs

Precision in, say, content delivery sounds like a sacred cow of sorts. How could 
it ever be wrong to give a user the right content?

How  about  every  time  a  personalization  project  fails?1  Every  perso-fail  is 
instructive in as much as it amounts to indictments of poorly designing with 
data. Figure 6.2 shows a popular example from Twitter.

This toilet seat is a household durable, not a household perishable, where a 
retargeting  tactic  might  make  somewhat  more  sense  as  a  marketing  “touch.” 
The  perso-fail  happens  well  upstream  of  the  Amazon  marketing  touch:  it’s 
really an oversight of the rule mechanics for how one system queries another,

munity site for those who design connected experiences.

probably a marketing automation platform (MAP) and a product information 
management (PIM) system.

When  personalization  fails,  it  is  almost  always  a  consequence  of  overfitting  a 
result, or set of results, that do not apply to the situation at hand. The design remedy 
is to bias for broader recall of a set of recommendations or possible actions, not a 
narrower subset, unless there is a strong signal from a user to confirm their intent.
Yet personalization programs, even “successful” ones, often run afoul of vanity 
metrics in this way, firing off waves of new optimizations, tests, and interventions 
while not doing enough to attend to broader use cases and needs for a more intel-
ligent, connected interaction. This happens often because of a test-and-learn capa-
bility that is maturing and seems well equipped to helm a personalization effort 
at large as well. Many organizations that seek to scale a personalized customer 
experience instead drift into the particular, thin-slicing dozens of narrow experi-
ments that cater to edge-case segmentations, ad-hoc promotions, UX hunches, or 
continuous improvement and optimization of set pages and interactions. These 
are  fundamentally  easier  and  more  confident  activities,  drilling  into  depths  of 
interaction choice details as opposed to the breadth of interaction choices to get at 
relevance for the test, the user, and the program owner’s organization.

Don’t get me wrong. Precisionism has its winning qualities: it’s going to be 
highly attributable, highly defensible, and probably low risk by virtue of affect-
ing so few users. But it is exactly that risk aversion that plays into corporate 
incentives to play it safe and cordon learnings off to carefully plotted corners of 
an experience. Too often, precisionism offers an illusion of progress: we’ve run 
hundreds of experiments!

I’ve  seen  this  pattern  play  out  more  dramatically  in  organizations  that  out-
source  their  testing  and  optimization  functions  and  incentivize  agencies  on  a 
volume throughput model rather than one to deliver against program ROI KPIs.
The other reason for this drift into particulars is that designing for the broad 
and common use cases is challenging. It is especially grueling for the declara-
tion and prioritization that it asks of business organizations: tell us what you 
want, in what order. Personalization’s grammar (roughly: if this, then that, for 
them) is a decoder ring of sorts where large organizations are more comfortable 
playing in the grey area of hedged bets and the status quo.

I have shared why some of the most crucial project work for my clients is in 
personalizing whole classes of digital elements, such as web forms or house ad 
placements or recirculation units: to get at a ground truth for how these func-
tion, whether they are dilutive or additive to business strategy, and how to make 
them  more  relevant.  Information  architects  like  to  talk  about  the  difference 
between breadth and depth, and I’m an inveterate advocate for the idea that 
depth is too often the business theater of those unwilling or unable to draft out 
the breadth of their CX—the jobs to be done.

The great win of this work is to get a comparative baseline for what that class 
of  element  does,  and  it  is  the  first  step  toward  simplifying  and  reducing  the 

Personalization and Content Operations  105

clutter and dilution that is taxing your users. It also breeds consistency of prac-
tice and measurement. We’re not evaluating a call-to-action tout based on how 
well it satisfies the KPI of a given test: we are able to see how this call to action 
performs amid all the calls in a given channel or site.

That  said,  I  am  an  advocate  for  incrementalism—when  it’s  embedded  in  a 
roadmap that is structurally sound and truly building toward mastery of the 
design real estate at hand in your digital and offline touchpoints. Progressive 
personalization is a framework not only for balancing user value and business 
benefit but also for generating a consistency of approach and parameters for 
how an organization personalizes interactions. When you get the fundamentals 
right, even the particulars flow more smoothly.

Designing for Connected Experience Is a Mission

Simplification  isn’t  simplistic,  but  it  is  the  end  state  of  any  truly  successful 
connected experience. “Simple” requires making the complex clear, and with 
encouraging results, even subtracting from the content presented. Subtraction 
is evidence of great focus and one of the great, if rare, feats of superior design, 
as industrial design hero Dieter Rams has said repeatedly in his career.

As confidence is achieved, intelligent experiences can trim, or visually deem-
phasize, say, marketing messaging that audience data indicates as unnecessary 
context  or  peripheral  information  to  most.  It  requires  someone  relentlessly 
focused on a project of continuous improvement, and it’s your mission—if you 
choose to accept it!—to get to the essence at the intersection of user and busi-
ness needs. It’s a consummate information architecture assignment, one that 
particularly favors a content specialist.

Connected Experience Demands an Ops State of Mind

Many have worked both long and widely enough in digital to see personaliza-
tion brave its journey from promise to pratfall to myth and back again. Lately, 
it’s made the run from white whale to white-hot all over again. Personalization 
is  reemerging  today  with  newfound  relevance,  sophistication,  and  ubiquity, 
thanks to a toolbox that ContentOps professionals are uniquely well qualified 
to deliver or own in organizations.

The real challenge with personalization is executional. It requires systems-

whisperers.

The best systems start simple. A winning approach to designing for personal-
ized experience in the warts-and-all reality of your tech stack is about incremen-
talism. Progressive steps to greater complexity, building on a firm foundation of 
learnings, will make your tactics more confident and the results more reliable.

The Battle for Breadth in Today’s CX Settings

Prioritization is really one of the great issues dogging otherwise good per-
sonalization programs that I know and encounter in the field, or I wouldn’t 
stress this principle of getting breadth right, first, before depth. But it’s big-
ger than that. Your assessment of value in personalization may be mistaken 
if precisionism is driving your decision making. A ContentOps professional 
understands that componentizing a content offering is key, while it does not 
need to be totalizing—not all content that could be personalized will or even 
should be. Eagan’s (2019) zoning approach guarantees an atomic-level con-
sideration for content items that must be componentized in order to be part 
of a progressive path to greater levels of automation or personalization.

For now, I implore you to keep in mind that aside from the formal challenge 

it may seem to pose, there’s real beauty in getting breadth right.

It’s not that UX professionals are better communicators or thinkers, though 
those  experienced  in  working  with  large  corpuses  of  content  or  data—think 
here of information architects especially, though not exclusively—are also fre-
quently  adept  at  what  Eli  Pariser,  author  of  The  Filter  Bubble,  calls  thinking 
in “wide categories” (2011). Again, the ContentOps aspect here is crucial, as 
breadth is the key challenge of componentizing content altogether. What is the 
right and most meaningful level of depth and detail?

The ability to land at meaningful generalizations is a recurring motif of effec-
tive personalization practice. Across the grammar of any given personalization 
intervention, generalizability is the ability to deliver repeat value in the content, 
the audience targeted, the recognizability and usability (therefore, reliability or 
implied  trustworthiness)  of  the  interaction  pattern  or  design  elements  used, 
and even when or why the personalized interaction occurs. It’s hard to fathom 
a more useful skill than the ability to think broadly  yet  accurately  about  the 
value users seek from their interactions with your digital products and services.

Practicality in Personalization: Moving to a Performance Mindset

One of the happiest side effects of a personalization program is the focus it puts 
on content’s role in contributing to planned outcomes. Performance is about 
more than a driver of top-line revenue. It’s about better ascertaining the perfor-
mance of discrete elements in your content offering.

As a certain en vogue perspective in product development has it, users “hire” a 
website, say, to do a job for them: to solve a problem or answer a question. There 
are two ways to win at this “job to be done,” as design and product wonks know:

• You can supply a satisfying answer, with easy access to ample supporting 
content or data that will bolster this answer’s credibility and additional topi-
cal depth for further exploration.

Personalization and Content Operations  107

• You can speed the user to that satisfying resolution—or even let them know 

with similar brevity that you cannot provide the answer in question.

Speed and relevance: practically, those are the performance criteria by which 
users judge an app session or site visit today. Personalization can help on each 
front and improve your chances of the site’s content, and overall experience, 
acquitting itself well to the user, therefore reducing effortful interactions and 
cognitive overload for them but also possibly directly addressing their ask in a 
cohesive, snappy manner. At their best, personalization programs are focused 
efforts  at  simplifying  the  customer  experience  and  speeding  their  journey, 
accelerating and scaling the effects of happy paths while accommodating and 
understanding the need for other paths, too.

Score Performance on a Scale of User Value Creation

For a variety of reasons, it may be beneficial to characterize the value created for 
a customer. How does your new feature, functionality, experience, or  product 
provide value in their eyes? A balanced personalization program should deliver 
on  a  bevy  of  lower-order  needs  even  if  it  does  nothing  life-changing:  saving 
users’  time  and  sparing  them  cognitive  overload  already  lets  them  attend  to 
goals they have elsewhere in their daily lives. Bain and Harvard Business Review 
have been advancing the ideas of a hierarchical model of user value (Almquist 
et  al.,  2016)  and  studying  its  sector-specific  variations.  You  may  have  user 
research or testing at hand to validate.

Personalization: Our Most Promising Solution to Information Overload

It’s hard to imagine a higher calling for digital professionals than that, but here’s 
one, in all sincerity: Repair the social fabric!

Luckily,  it’s  also  the  path  to  an  ethically  alive  and  alert  regime  for  any  
decision making that involves AI or machine learning in one’s personalization 
regime. Explainable AI, or XAI, is fast becoming a legal and ethical operating 
requirement—just  as  being  able  to  decompose  your  automation  query  logic 
(more about that grammar below) is essential to monitoring, auditing, and test-
ing those interactions for their verifiable fairness and transparency. Fantastic 
work in this regard has been underway for years in the recommender system 
community, such as at the PIReT Ship team at Boise State University (PIReT, 
2021), and fairly resembles the ethical table stakes for anyone designing and 
delivering personalized activities. It all comes down to the grammar that makes 
any  personalized  interaction  identifiable,  repeatable,  and  scalable.  We  make 
those foundational underpinnings strong by leveraging the structural elements 
of our content.

108  Content Operations from Start to Scale

The so-called attention economy view is that, increasingly, only personalized 
or algorithmically driven messages will reach us—therefore favoring those who 
begin  orchestrating  their  marketing  and  communications  in  this  way.  In  the 
early days of the web, this preoccupation was findability; now it’s a matter of 
discoverability and of finding users where they spend their time between, say, 
their  messaging,  inboxes,  and  social  media.  Amid  the  demand  for  discover-
ability of your organization’s products and information, there is a public service 
of simply, as we’ve said, saving users precious time. Behavioral scientists talk 
about IA as a choice architecture, a setting in which nudges can guide users 
toward the appropriate information “scent” that will drive better outcomes, ide-
ally, for them and the organization.

At its noblest, designing for connected experience is about alleviating and rem-
edying the enfeebling paradox of choice and information overload that so many 
of us encounter around a multitude of daily decisions, the infinite spread of con-
sumption possibilities our hyperconnected world has laid chaotically at our feet.

Localization and Content Operations

Localization Overview

The Localization Profession

Localization  is  a  global  industry  that  focuses  on  translating  content  and  other 
types of deliverables from one language to another with an eye on making the 
language  output  either  globally  appropriate  or  locally  appropriate.  Sometimes, 
localization and translation can be used interchangeably. In this chapter, I provide 
an overview of localization (and its related terms and practices), and then I focus 
on the interesting intersections between Content Operations and localization.

The most obvious intersection of localization and ContentOps is their focus 
on the written word—its quality and usage—as well as language and their inte-
grated  processes,  handoffs,  and  shared  publishing  systems.  The  localization 
business  is  largely  outsourced.  While  there  are  full-time  equivalents  (FTEs) 
employed  throughout  the  process,  translation  work  is  frequently  performed 
by freelancers. Consequently, a big focus of the industry is budget availability, 
optimized processes, and scalable technology. 

Before we go too deep, a good place to begin is with some key industry defi-
nitions.  You  will  see  acronyms  related  to  functions  that  are  commonly  used 
within the profession. Each acronym is determined by the number of letters 
between  the  first  and  last  letter  of  the  word.  For  example,  translation  has  9

letters after the T and before the final N. (A fun party game is matching people 
to their acronym. For example, my name, Loy, is L1Y according to this abbre-
viation system.) For a history lesson, you can Google the origin of i18n. If you 
find  yourself  writing  internationalization  many  times  a  day,  you  will  quickly 
understand why these abbreviations have become so deeply ingrained within 
the industry. Figure 7.1 includes some definitions of fundamental terminology 
for the localization industry.

Translation  (T9n)  is  taking  a  concept  or  an  idea  in  one  language  and 
expressing it in another language. A proper translation requires that you really 
understand  what  you’re  expressing  conceptually,  including  its  context,  audi-
ence, and purpose. A bad translation is a literal word-for-word expression from 
the source language. 

A translator’s work starts with inherited source content. The translator must 
make  sense  of  someone  else’s  words  to  do  their  job.  Consequently,  they  will 
find gaps and problems in the source content, so a good feedback mechanism 
between content and localization is essential. 

Localization  (l10n)  is  often  considered  synonymous  with  translation,  but 
it involves more than that. (Actually, translation is generally considered to be 
an  aspect  of  localization.)  Localization  is  perceived  as  the  broader  category. 
To localize implies that you are going a step beyond translation to make your 
deliverable appropriate for a specific locale (e.g., country, state, region), indus-
try, or work. The process of localizing can be intense!

Also, to add to the fun, localization is what the overall industry is called. You 

can see why translation and localization get confused. 

While we usually think about localization as making something appropriate 
for a specific language and locale combination, often the work supports many 
locales that use a language. For example, Spanish is spoken in many countries, 
but the local terminology (and in some cases, even grammar) can vary by coun-
try. A common practice in the industry is to attempt to standardize the Spanish 
in a way that it can be understood in many locales. Latin American Spanish or 
Neutral Spanish are two approaches that allow an organization to address many 
locales with one language. 

There  are  two  focus  areas  for  localization.  One  is  language  localization—
which  is  often  a  synonym  for  translation.  The  other  area  is  product  feature 
localization. In some industry sectors, there is no distinct difference between 
these two areas. If a product works the same globally as it does locally, there 
may  be  no  unique  feature  localization  requirement.  An  example  might  be 
Gmail—which does work the same way in most countries. 

However,  in  highly  regulated  industries  (such  as  finance,  banking,  and 
accounting), these two types of localization are often differentiated. The reason 
for this differentiation is that a translator does not have the ability to make a 
product work properly locally—they can only change the words or labeling. If  
a  product  must  behave  differently,  perform  different  calculations,  or  work

differently  in  another  market  (outside  of  what  is  typically  handled  through 
internationalization),  the  product  will  need  to  be  designed  and  coded  for 
that different local functionality. For example, tax rules can vary by country, 
state, county, and city. There can be multiple types of taxes. The work to adapt  
a  financial  product  requires  product  feature  localization  that  goes  beyond  
label translations. 

Internationalization (i18n)  is  the  practice  of  ensuring  that  your  products 
will work globally. There is a long list of items that fall within this grouping, but 
here is a standard summary: date formats, calendar formats, externalized text 
to enable translations, country and city codes, labels and address formats, and 
currency and number formats, among others.

Globalization (G11n) has a couple of different meanings. It can mean the 
geopolitical  global  redistribution  of  work,  such  as  in  manufacturing—where 
we’ve seen an industry shift work from the home country to another country as 
a result of cheaper labor or resource costs. This is not the definition of globali-
zation that I will be covering. 

Globalization, as it relates to the localization industry, is generally considered 
to be the broadest term used to cover what we do within the industry. When 
a company is planning to take its products global, there are many tasks that 
must be done to make this move effective. The practice of completing all the 
tasks involved in making a product work globally is often called globalization. 
A product can also be “globalized,” which means that all these activities have 
been  done. The  globalization  tasks  that  I  will  address  in  this  chapter  will  be 
limited to the ones that typically impact the localization profession. 

Globalization  frequently  includes  translation,  localization  (language  and 
product features), and internationalization. Within a large company, there may 
be teams that specialize in each area, and it’s common for them to be organized 
together or, at a minimum, to work very closely together daily. 

So, localization and globalization teams can be the same—often because organ-
ization names can have a long shelf life, while team members can fluctuate over 
time. In general, a globalization team almost always includes ownership of most 
of all these components. Regardless of a team’s name, there will likely be people in 
roles responsible for accomplishing goals in each of these domain areas.

How the Client and Supplier Sides of the Industry Work Together

As I mentioned above, localization is largely an outsourced profession. Trans-
lators live all around the world—most often in their native country. They are 
usually freelance workers who are employed by translation vendors or suppli-
ers, or, on occasion, directly by customers. The business of localization requires 
many roles for support. Some roles are similar on both the customer and sup-
plier sides of the business. 

Localization and Content Operations  113

The supplier side of the industry is broken down by very large multi-language 
vendors (MLVs), single-language vendors (SLVs), and freelancers. MLVs typically 
engage with many SLVs or smaller MLVs as well as freelancers. A large part of 
this side of the business is finding and managing those resources. The real work 
of “translating” is often done by trained linguists who likely specialize in certain 
types of translation work or in a specific industry (medical, software, or marketing, 
for example) and may work for one or more vendors supporting multiple clients. 
On the vendor side, a project manager (PM) handles customer submissions 
through  the  translation,  review,  desktop  publishing  (DTP),  and  testing  pro-
cesses.  On  the  client  side,  a  PM  works  with  requests  coming  through  from 
internal stakeholders, through to the vendor—including pricing, timing, and 
so forth—and back through review, approval, perhaps testing, and delivery to 
the internal stakeholders. As a result, these roles have some similarity but can 
be  experienced  quite  differently.  Both  roles  require  exceptional  organization 
and communication skills, attention to detail, and technical understanding of 
the deliverable types.

Localization is very similar to a supply-chain business. Imagine if Amazon 
delivered awesome translations instead of sending packages. There is a similar 
level  of  complexity  with  work  flowing  around  the  world  on  tight  deadlines: 
aligning people who can do each part of the complex process and managing 
estimates,  payments,  different  currencies,  different  global  schedules,  special 
demand  over  holidays,  global  business,  occasional  misdeliveries  or  returns, 
quality  challenges,  and  customer  feedback.  Because  of  the  complex  nature  
of  the  industry,  automation,  process,  and  scalable  systems  are  critical  to 
daily operations—as are amazing people who understand the work. It’s a fun  
profession that has a tightly tuned sense of time everywhere. 

To normalize localization work across clients, vendors, and freelancers, the 
unit of work in this industry is frequently the word. Cost is often a blend of 
word rates and hourly rates for tasks that are less measurable. It’s important to 
not just consider word rates as the core cost, as every project typically involves 
PM  work  as  well  as  perhaps  review,  testing,  and  other  responsibilities.  That 
said, this is a highly budget-conscious profession. Everything is counted, meas-
ured, estimated, and validated. So, while it’s a bit like Amazon from a supply-
chain-management  standpoint,  it  is  also  like  a  procurement  function,  where 
every dollar must be well managed. This is true on both the supplier and client 
sides of the business. 

How Localization Works 

Localization  is  a  blend  of  technology,  process,  and  internal  and  vendor- 
managed people. It’s a profession that relies heavily on process and technol-
ogy. To best understand how localization works, I’ll dive into the technology  

114  Content Operations from Start to Scale

landscape  that  intersects  most  with  ContentOps,  cover  the  standard  
processes,  and  then  review  the  intersection  points  between  localization  
and ContentOps.

Technology and Translation Memories 

Localization  leans  heavily  on  third-party  technology  solutions.  In  the  past, 
these tools were often highly customized on premises. Today, most providers 
have  shifted  to  cloud-based  applications.  Following  are  the  technology  ele-
ments from the localization industry that intersect with Content Operations:

• Translation memories (TMs). The core capability within a TMS or transla-

tion workbench that powers translation.

• Translation management systems (TMS). The translation workflow system.
• Terminology management (term bases, or TBs).
• Query management and issue/bug reporting.
• Machine translation (MT). 
• Publishing tools. 

Translation Memories

The one capability that is unique and fundamental to localization is translation 
memories (TMs), a database of all the sentences or text strings that have been 
translated in the past in both the source and target languages.

When a project is analyzed the first time it gets translated, it is added to the 
translation memories. Both the source and the target translations are saved and 
matched. The next time the same project comes through, maybe with a per-
centage of changed material, that project will be compared (analyzed) against 
the existing memory, and only the changed segments will require translation. 
All segments will appear and can be edited, but the translator can quickly work 
through just the new and changed segments. Translation memories minimize 
rework  and  reduce  costs  by  ensuring  that  time  and  money  are  not  spent  on 
unchanged or only lightly changed segments. 

A new project will come through with no or a very low percentage of matches. 
If it returns with updates from a new release, there will be a percentage of “fuzzy 
matches”—indicating  that  strings  (or  sentences)  partially  match  the  existing 
memories. If part of a phrase is changed, it will become a fuzzy match. A project 
with many fuzzy matches will be cheaper to translate than a new project. If a sen-
tence is exactly the same as a previous translation, and nothing changed when it 
was resubmitted to translation, this sentence will be a 100% match. If the context 
is also exactly the same, and the sentence has not changed (as in the same file 

Localization and Content Operations  115

resubmitted in the next release), it will be considered an ICE (in-context exact) 
match. ICE matches are typically free (100% matches are very inexpensive). The 
lower the fuzzy match percentage, the higher the word rate for the translation. 
Therefore, savings are incurred through always analyzing every new and changed 
file against the TMs to “leverage” from the previous translation. 

A  new  sentence  can  benefit  from  leverage  if  rigorous  standards  are  used 
in the source files. These standards can include repetition of commonly used 
phrases, as a new file can come in with some fuzzy matches. 

Changing  source  files  once  they’ve  been  translated  can  be  problematic.  
Gratuitous change should be avoided if possible, as even changing punctuation 
standards will change segments. My best guidance is this: If something needs 
to be changed, change it. A penny saved in translation living with a poor source 
language sentence isn’t worth it. Make your content better, and those improve-
ments will flow through the language translations. 

From a process standpoint, an ICE match will likely not be reviewed in the 
translation process, as it didn’t change. Fuzzy matches typically are reviewed 
within the translation process. If the original file was not properly reviewed the  
first time, it’s possible that a poor translation within the memories can be reused.  
A good common practice is to spot-check even ICE matches to ensure that the 
overall quality of the deliverable remains high. 

Translation memories are an investment, as ensuring that quality is high will 
improve the quality of future deliverables. Do it right the first time, and less 
money will be spent downstream. 

Translation Management System (TMS)

A translation management system is the first and most important tool that will 
be purchased by your localization translation team. It is a workflow solution 
as well as a translation workbench that supports translation activities such as 
translation memory management, terminology management, and sometimes 
query  and  quality  management.  It  may  also  have  basic  financial  handling 
capability (preparing quotes, estimating, and handling invoices, for example). 
Lastly, it will include some reporting capabilities. 

Today, most TMSs are cloud-based software offered as a service solution, but 
many large companies are still using on-premises solutions that they likely cus-
tomized  years  ago.  A  TMS  is  a  highly  specialized  system  that  is  designed  to 
support client-side work initiation, the transfer to vendor-side for translation, 
review, and other post-processing work, then back again to the client side for 
linguistic  quality  analysis,  testing,  subject  matter  expert  reviews  or  sign-offs, 
and  then  delivery.  A  robust  TMS  can  handle  different  types  of  work—from 
user interface to marketing content, to help manuals or training materials, to 
video content. 

116  Content Operations from Start to Scale

Terminology Management

Another  unique  capability  within  translation  is  terminology  management. 
Almost  all  translation  workbenches  have  integrated  terminology  manage-
ment,  and  there  are  third-party  terminology  management  systems.  Ter-
minology  is  important  because  translators  are  generalists  and  may  not 
understand  a  specific  company’s  or  industry’s  terminology.  This  enables  a 
translator to do an acceptable job, even if they are not deeply experienced 
with a given company’s content. 

If  terminology  is  not  defined,  a  translator  will  either  research  it  (which  is 
time-consuming), guess (which is a risky bad practice), or request a definition 
while  they  are  translating  the  work  (which  may  or  may  not  arrive  in  time). 
Therefore, term definition is ideally a proactive task within translation, but it is 
often also reactive.

Writer  glossaries  can  be  imported  into  terminology  databases  (or  
term  bases)  to  provide  a  good  start  for  translators.  As  translators  do  their 
work,  they  will  identify  terms  from  the  term  base  to  improve  consistency,  
or  they  can  define  or  flag  them  for  future  definition.  Term  bases  include  
both  the  source  and  the  target  terms.  They  can  be  simple  equivalents  or 
much  richer,  depending  upon  the  investment  and  need.  Key  terms  will  
contain  more  information  than  a  simple  writer  glossary  will,  such  as  a  
“concept” or what it means, perhaps an example, gender, associated domains, 
and more.  Because terminology  consistency  is part  of the  translation  pro-
cess  supported  by  automation,  translation  terminology  handling  is  often 
more consistent than the source content, which may lack these checks. Also,  
terminology  can  be  aligned  across  many  types  of  deliverables  for  even 
greater consistency. 

Both  translation  memories  and  term  bases  are  core  elements  of  the  
translation  process.  They  enable  translation  organizations  to  truly  align 
voice, tone, style, product, and feature names as well as terminology across a 
company. Obsolete names are also tracked to ensure that they are not used. 
This  is  difficult  to  achieve  in  a  source  language  when  many  teams  tend  to 
create content. 

Industry Publishing Tools

Localization typically does not own its publishing tools. Localized content is 
typically published into whatever tool the request comes from (GitHub, content 
management systems, knowledge management systems, learning management 
systems, community sites, and so on). This means that localization teams need 
familiarity with a wide range of tools to validate deliverables, perform in-con-
text review, and automate handoffs. 

Localization and Content Operations  117

Machine Translation (MT) or Neural MT (NMT)

Machine  translation  is  just  that:  a  machine  taking  a  stab  at  translating  
from  one  language  to  another,  based  upon  grammar  rules  and  common  
terminology.  Standard  MT  is  trained  via  rules,  and  NMT  leverages  
machine learning. 

Machine translation has become ubiquitous in the translation industry. The  
quality  levels  have  improved,  and  with  NMT—which  is  MT  that  learns— 
the naturalness of speech has come a long way from the early days of BabelFish. 
MT is a common capability within most translation teams today. It is used for 
“gisting” as well as preloading a translation with an MT suggestion. MT is rarely 
used for customer consumption unless it is “post-edited” by a human reviewer 
or unless a user directly requests it. Because it is machine-generated, tricky or 
highly technical terminology, colloquialisms, and poor-quality source material 
can all have a negative impact on the target language quality. For this reason, 
the best practice is to train the MT so it improves through feedback via post-
editing and a high volume of good examples. 

MT  quality  can  vary  by  language  and  by  the  nature  of  the  content  being 
translated. If you have used Google Translate, you have used an NMT solution. 
NMT is trained by processing huge volumes of language strings. Longer-tail 
languages tend to perform more poorly, as there is less data to train the engines. 
Linguistic  distance  from  the  source  language  is  also  a  factor  that  impacts  
quality—the greater the distance, the lower the starting quality. Western lan-
guages tend to be closer, so the results can be surprisingly good. MT quality 
is measured by the distance between the machine translation and the human 
post-edit. Few edits imply good quality. 

When  and  how  to  use  MT  requires  careful  thought  about  quality,  the  
audience,  the  languages,  the  shelf  life  of  the  content,  and  the  urgency  of  an 
immediate  translation.  It’s  a  highly  useful  capability,  but  across  the  board,  it 
does not yet have an edge over human translation. 

Raw MT

MT is considered raw when it is served up without a post-edit or human review. 
MT is rarely served up raw unless one or more of the following is true: 

• A user specifically asks for it (you request Google to translate a screen in 

another language). Your quality expectations should be appropriate.

• The MT has been well trained, the quality levels have been vetted, and the 

deliverable is appropriate for MT.

• The deliverable has a very short shelf life (e.g., a blog or newscast tran-

scription). Timeliness matters more than quality.

118  Content Operations from Start to Scale

• The deliverable’s quality is not important (either to the user or perhaps to 

the company that hosts it). 

• Gisting is sufficient (you need just enough information to generally under-
stand something; perfection is not required and would be a waste of time 
and money). 

• Providing a pre-MT suggestion is part of a translation process to save time.

If you do use raw MT, you should tell your readers and ideally let them make 
the decision to consume it. This will spare you a lot of quality problems (and 
some embarrassment). 

Query Management or Issue/Bug Tracking Tool

Translators  often  work  with  content  out  of  context,  and  they  often  translate 
material  that  is  new  to  them.  Consequently,  they  will  have  questions  when 
translating. A query management system helps handle these queries and typi-
cally integrates with a bug tracking system and terminology management. If 
forty different language translators have the same question when translating a 
project, imagine how happy your subject matter experts will be to triage forty 
versions of the same question!

Query  management  emerged  to  help  streamline  questions  that  would  be 
applicable to many languages or that might reveal a bug or a need for new ter-
minology. Queries could also be language-specific. Answers to queries need to 
be quick to catch the project while it is still in flight. Queries are first reviewed 
by the vendor; then they go to a PM or a linguist on the client side—depending 
upon the type of query. Next, they might go to a subject matter expert (like a 
writer) for their help. Lastly, they may go to an engineer if a bug is determined 
to be the cause of the query. Some TMSs have query management capabilities, 
and  bug  systems  can  be  customized  for  this  purpose  as  well.  There  are  also 
purpose-built tools for this work that can integrate with a TMS, terminology 
system, and issue management system. 

Translation Projects and Process

The common unit of work within this field is a “project,” which can consist of 
many types of files or deliverables that are parsed by number of words. The type 
of file or work being done can vary wildly, and here are some examples of com-
mon types of work that is translated:

• Marketing sites and content.
• Product user interface (UI).

Localization and Content Operations  119

• Physical assets, such as brochures, books, banners, stands, and products.
• Videos, movies, and games. 
• Help and user content, support, community, instructional content and tuto-

rials, and presentations.

• Legal documents.
• Transactional content or data. 

Localization  teams  typically  handle  broad  types  of  deliverables.  Some  
deliverables  will  be  predictable  daily  activities;  many  will  be  ad  hoc.  Thus,  
localization  teams  must  be  comfortable  working  with  all  content  types  and 
technology—and  their  vendors  must  be  equally  proficient.  Each  deliverable 
type will have a defined process that can differ by audience, quality expecta-
tions, time available, and budget. 

Almost  every  one  of  the  deliverables  above  will  undergo  more  than  just 
translation within the localization process. There will usually be reviews and 
perhaps  testing,  in-context  validation,  DTP  work,  and  so  on.  Video  work  or 
custom work can follow a different process, and it’s not uncommon for a trans-
lation team to have a dozen or more commonly used workflows. Figure 7.2 pre-
sents a standard translation process coming from a client through to a vendor.
This process assumes no hiccups, rejections, late deliveries, or mishaps. When 
reviewing  the  process,  it’s  important  to  consider  the  nature  of  the  business 
requesting the work. Some businesses have thoughtful, predictable deadlines for 
much of their work, while others function in hyperdrive. Some work requires 
impeccable  quality  with  multiple  checks.  Within  a  business,  not  all  content  is 
equal: some work may be highly visible, important, and durable, but other con-
tent may have a very short shelf life or require fewer quality checks. Indeed, while 
fifty companies may have a very similar high-level, the experience can be wildly 
different depending upon the nature of their business, pace, and deliverables. 

Localization teams are wired to build scalable processes and technology. This 
is not just nice to have—it’s survival! Imagine a medium, three-person-sized 
project being translated into 70 languages. This project might be sent to 210 
translators  all  around  the  world,  with  another  70  reviewers.  Their  availabil-
ity for work requires engagement and planning. If work is delayed, resources 
might be committed elsewhere, resulting in delivery delays. Now imagine that 
there are 20 of these projects coming through every day from different teams. 
Ideally, there is a continuous flow of work to the vendor from the customer, 
so a ready set of resources familiar with the company’s requirements will be 
on  hand.  If  not,  recognize  that  it  takes  time  to  build,  nurture,  and  mature  a 
resource team. Ultimately, it’s a people business underneath all the automation 
and process optimization. The quality of the translation depends not just upon 
a great process and tools but also good source materials, clear guidelines and 
standards, sufficient time, and most importantly, knowledgeable, committed, 
and highly capable translators, engineers, and PMs.

Localization and Content Operations  121

Translators often work for many customers through one or more vendors. 
They  are  usually  paid  by  the  word—which  means  the  faster  they  work,  the  
more they get paid. One of the best ways to ensure a quality translation is to 
verify  that  the  source  is  clear,  clean,  concise,  and  unproblematic  to  process. 
Imagine 280 people in different countries trying to make sense out of a poorly 
written English text, and then imagine what the language quality will look like 
in their end deliverable. “Garbage in, garbage out” was a phrase tailor-made for 
this industry. You cannot ensure a great translation with a great source, but you 
can ensure a poor translation with a poor source.

Translators are also generalists. If you have a vendor who retains the human 
resources  working  with  your  account,  their  knowledge  of  your  products, 
voice, tone, style, and terminology will grow over time—so your translations 
will improve over time as well. They also don’t have a direct line to the crea-
tor of the content that they are translating. Most vendor and client teams have 
“query  management”  processes  and  tooling  to  streamline  fast  responses  to 
translators while they work to ensure that they don’t have to guess. Often, the 
answer misses the translator but catches the reviewer, who can make a change, 
if needed, based upon the answers given. These queries are likely to first be tri-
aged by the vendor and then by the client-side localization team, which may 
then  reach  out  to  internal  stakeholders  for  answers.  It’s  a  game  of  telephone 
via workflow automation—and is always a race against the clock to meet the 
deadline for when the project is due. 

The best results come from well-integrated technology that is optimized to 
minimize human handoffs of projects on both the vendor and client sides. A 
strong TMS optimized to automate predictable handoffs reduces human errors 
and  idiosyncrasies  and  minimizes  process  time.  The  best  results  come  from 
a  rock-solid,  tight  process  that  is  predictable,  reliable,  understandable,  well 
documented,  and  (wherever  reasonably  possible)  automated.  Your  process 
should provide good information to the translators in the form of glossaries, 
references, in-context source content, responsive query management, quality 
assessment, and feedback. 

I emphasize that localization is a process-heavy industry, because the goal is 
typically to take whatever is thrown at us in one language and quickly get that 
translated into many languages, make certain that it reads beautifully, works, 
and is tested or validated, evaluated, and often even personalized or custom-
ized for a specific market or type of customer before it is delivered as expected,  
without  too  much  drama  or  fanfare  visible  to  the  requesting  stakeholder. 
Underneath it all are the translators, reviewers, and testers doing great work, 
PMs on the client and vendor sides keeping it all flowing without a hitch, engi-
neers keeping the tools working and automating as new work types come in, 
and engagement skills at all levels to work smoothly across different cultures, 
time zones, and companies.

Does Contact Strategy Impact Localization?

Localization processes can handle almost any content process that is capable 
of externalizing text into a common format or has application programming 
interfaces (APIs) compatible with standard translation formats. That said, an 
authoring process that separates content from its published structure can save 
costs in translation. If content is reused in multiple types of deliverables and the 
markup is not changed by each system that reuses that content, those content 
strings will flow through translation with a high fuzzy matching score—or, if 
unchanged, a 100% matching score.

Content reuse can create savings in translation—as much as it does in writ-
ing.  However,  it  can  be  taken  to  levels  that  are  useless  or  sometimes  prob-
lematic within translations. For example, partial sentences or snippets strung 
together  or  mixed  with  standard  text  can  flow  through  translation,  but  they 
cannot function the same way within published translations as they do within 
the source content. Each snippet simply becomes part of the whole translated 
string and must be divorced from the original snippet in the target language. 
This is because grammar differs across languages, and partial sentences will not 
have the same grammar structure in other languages. These simply don’t work 
in other languages. If the CMS supports conversion of snippets to regular text, 
this won’t present a problem within translation. 

Content workflow, change management, and version control also impact local-
ization  processes.  If  content  is  dynamically  changing  and  is  also  submitted  to 
translations dynamically, version control and workflow steps that include trans-
lation  handoffs  and  returns  must  be  in  place.  Without  them,  there  will  be  no 
way to ensure alignment between the writing and translation processes. If these 
capabilities don’t exist on the authoring side, a translation cutoff will need to be 
determined, and translations will likely not be done dynamically but rather at set 
dates—catching  what’s  changed  since  the  last  iteration,  and  often  not  aligning 
with the source language until the brief period of the next catch-up project. 

Another area that is often overlooked within content strategy is alignment of 
user experience and voice, tone, style, and personas across all—and I do mean 
all—content  types.  There  may  be  additional  roles  with  some  deliverables,  or 
more focus on a specific demographic for one product area, but there should 
be an overarching goal to show up in front of your customers sounding like the 
same self-aware company. This matters because content will be reused by peo-
ple, and those clashes will show up in the source language and cause rework of 
duplicative content. Also, your customers don’t care about your organizational 
structure.  They  consume  content  across  organizational  silos  and  experience 
those  organizational  disconnects.  Lastly,  members  of  a  localization  team  see 
every one of these disconnects, and they may be able to normalize some of this 
in  each  target  language—but  they  can’t  prevent  the  disconnect  that  typically 
exists across all the content organizations. 

Localization and Content Operations  123

One great practice that can improve the overall content experience is authoring  
content  through  the  customer  process  engagement  lens,  rather  than  by  func-
tional area. If a customer starts in marketing—looking at the product, then pur-
chasing it, then training on how to use it, then starting to use it, having questions 
that might be answered by help or community, or having issues to resolve with 
support, they would prefer a more seamless process that is aware of what came 
before and what comes next and also demonstrates some consistency of voice, 
tone,  style,  and  user  experience.  This  type  of  design-driven  process  typically 
requires communication and sharing between the different content systems, plus 
common taxonomy and metadata. This approach should also include localiza-
tion to ensure that country, language, and local content can be factored in as well.

Do Content Operations Impact Localizations? 

Most localization teams aspire to highly automated handoffs, streamlined pro-
cesses that leverage standards, predictability, and tight communication. When 
our partner organizations share the same motivation, amazing things are pos-
sible.  Handoffs  can  be  fully  automated,  and  post-production  pre-publishing 
rework  can  be  minimized  or  eliminated.  Less  internal  localization  labor  is 
required to fix or compensate for poor structure, processes, tooling, publish-
ing, and planning from the requesting content team. 

If ContentOps are well managed with tight processes and technical integra-
tions  that  collaboratively  engage  and  factor  in  localizations,  savings  in  time, 
cost, and process friction are a given. Content and localization teams are often 
closely integrated and perform as happy partners. Both organizations usually 
love structure, process, and robust enterprise tooling. 

One of the biggest challenges that localization teams encounter is when con-
tent teams seek to overstep their domain and try to solve localization problems 
within their content silo. A content team that introduces a separate localization 
tool or MT solution is not doing the company or their localization team a favor. 
They are instead introducing friction, doubling the processes of the localization 
team, and likely increasing costs and delivery times while decreasing quality 
outputs. In short, don’t shop for localization tools. Work with your localization 
team on how to optimize your team’s processes and handoffs to work most effi-
ciently within the localization team’s processes.

Bundled authoring solutions that include translation tools are only a great 
thing when the localization team also wants to use those tools and joins in 
the process of selecting the right collaborative solutions with a strong partner 
voice at the table. A last point on this: If your content will be translated, you’ll 
need to include your localization team as an equal partner in the technology 
selection processes. If you purchase a CMS that only works in English, you 
won’t be solving for your company or your customers. If search only works 

124  Content Operations from Start to Scale

in English, or global fonts are not supported, keep shopping. If there are no 
APIs, or if your tool of choice suffers from lack of interoperability by creating 
its own translation tools within the product … run, don’t walk, away from 
that solution! It will be gone within 3+ years, and the folks who chose it will 
likely be gone too. 

Few companies today manage content in a holistic manner. Because localiza-
tion can’t impose order upstream, they focus on API integration of standard 
industry tools so that translations can all be processed in an efficient manner 
through their localization processes, avoiding one-offs and manual handoffs. 
Content organizations are often organized functionally, indexing toward their 
organization and audience demands, and therefore they will use different types 
of content management tools:

• Structured  content  or  Darwin  Information  Typing  Architecture  (DITA) 

CMS for technical publications.

• Learning management systems (LMS) for training organizations.
• Knowledge management systems (KMS) for support organizations.
• Marketing CMS, digital asset management systems, website management, 

and more for marketing organizations. 

• File management systems for engineering teams. 

Because  all  these  systems  typically  handoff  to  translations,  the  process 
requires  APIs,  plus  a  baseline  of  global  maturity,  in  each  of  these  content-
related systems.

Summary

The localization profession is a rich field that leans heavily on process, technol-
ogy, and outsourced services managed by internal teams. While both the locali-
zation and content professions focus on delivering the right words for the right 
role and purpose, localization tends to focus more energy on scalable processes 
than the content field does. That said, there are similarities and dependencies 
with Content Operations and strategy. Most dependencies and similarities are 
tied to shared deliverables, joined processes, and technology to transform and 
deliver source-language content into localized content.

The Technology that Supports  
Content Operations

Patrick Bosek

Content  Operations  intrinsically  relies  on  systems  and  tools.  In  the  purest 
conceptual sense, ContentOps could be separated from technology, but prac-
tically speaking, the two are deeply intertwined. The way in which you imple-
ment your technology will be driven by how you implement your processes, 
and vice versa. 

This chapter explores the technology that supports ContentOps and some of 
the choices that it presents to you. The intention is to leave you with a broad 
understanding of what’s available and how to use it in your ContentOps eco-
system. It is worth noting that in this chapter I will avoid making any specific 
tooling recommendations.

When starting a ContentOps project, especially before arriving at technology 
selection and implementation, you’ll want to have a strong plan. In this chapter, 
I’m introducing a battle card1 as a helpful way to organize the high-level aspects 
of this plan. Later in the chapter, I’ll talk about filling it in. 

1  “Battle cards are internal documents used in the sales field that compile key infor-
mation and scripts about specific products or services, the market in which they’re 
sold, brand competitors and target customers. Sales professionals can quickly refer-
ence battle cards during calls and presentations to locate important statistics, fig-
ures, product specifications, clips and other details that may strengthen their pitch.

Before We Start Building … 

Let’s start by asking some key questions and going through some basic plan-
ning. This planning work will be the basis for all of the technology decisions 
that you make downstream. Some of these questions will be readdressed at the 
end of the chapter, when we look at filling in a project battle card. However, it’s 
good to ask them up front so some of the thinking is fresh in our minds as we 
consider the technical details of a ContentOps infrastructure.

What Channels?

Here, you should gather a quick list of known near-term and likely future chan-
nels  for  content  publication.  At  this  point,  it’s  important  to  know  which  
channels are definitives, but also to have some maybes in mind. Without the 
maybes, you can get too locked into the definitives that are right in front of 
you.  One  of  the  recurring  themes  during  the  implementation  process  that  I 

In  addition,  battle  cards  may  include  tactics  to  overcome  sales  barriers,  such  as 
customer objections, competitor comparisons and more” (Indeed Editorial Team, 
2021).

The Technology that Supports Content Operations  127

recommend will be avoiding blinders and short-term thinking—and looking 
toward future channels is an important part of this effort.

What Content?

Outlining and documenting what content is in scope is an important aspect of 
planning because it allows you to focus on the solution space and know when 
that changes. When another group with a different kind of content wants to 
start leveraging the ContentOps ecosystem, this possible collaboration is a dis-
crete event that can trigger the proper planning and implementation.

Which Collaborators?

The people involved in this implementation can’t be an afterthought; indeed, 
they must be one of the first things you think about. Their objectives, prefer-
ences, digital territory, roles, background, and physical location all play signifi-
cant roles in how they participate in the ContentOps ecosystem. Later in this 
chapter, I will present some planning strategies that dig into this a bit more.

How Much Consistency Do You Need?

This seems like a fake question, but it’s actually something to consider. Different 
types of content need different levels of consistency. Informal, single-channel 
content (like many blogs) doesn’t require much consistency. It’s fine if differ-
ent authors take different approaches to visuals, layout, voice, and markup. On 
the other end of the spectrum, instructions for use (IFUs) for medical devices 
require tight controls around consistency of source content. For more on this, 
you can read chapter 5 in this collection, where Rahel Bailie and Carlos Evia 
introduce levels of robustness for ContentOps implementations.

Additionally,  it’s  very  common  to  have  multiple  content  types  that  require 
different levels of attention to consistency. Therefore, it’s important to catalog 
this before our next phase. 

How Much Structure and Semantics?

When entering into the information architecture and planning phase later on, 
you’ll need to do some concrete work on defining the required structure and 
semantics.  For  now,  it’s  helpful  to  start  thinking  about  the  “is-ness”  of  your 
content and how important it is. An easy example is codeblocks. Is semantically 

128  Content Operations from Start to Scale

defining a block of code as a codeblock (this content is code) important? This 
one is easy, because almost every organization that has code in its documenta-
tion will answer “yes.” Other parts of your content will be trickier. 

Well-defined semantics unlock tons of potential for efficiency and user expe-
rience improvements, but they also create overhead for those maintaining the 
content. More semantics aren’t inherently better—it’s a balance.

How Much Metadata Do You Need?

Metadata,  as  we’re  using  it  here,  is  on-object  metadata.  This  will  sometimes 
be referred to as tagging or classifying content. This is different from content 
semantics that are in line with the content, even though semantics are also tech-
nically metadata.

Generally,  more  content  means  that  you  need  more  metadata,  but  it’s  not 
always that simple. Another major factor in determining how much metadata 
you need is how much similar content you have. When different pieces of con-
tent  are  very  similar  but  distinct  in  important  ways  (e.g.,  a  repair  procedure 
for two different versions of a product), it becomes harder for standard search 
mechanisms to identify the correct piece of content without the user specifying 
some additional information to filter results.

The Technical Goals of a ContentOps Stack

• Interoperability—accessible  via  an  Application  Programming  Interface 

(API) and friendly

• Predictability
• Governance
• Auditability

The core technical goal of a ContentOps stack is to automate things. This auto-
mation can take many forms, but at the end of the day, almost everything that 
you implement has the goal of automating something. As you’re considering the 
implementation, one of the best questions to ask is “What are the most impor-
tant  things  to  automate?”  This  question  can  inform  which  technologies  you 
choose, because different technologies excel in different types of automation.

Content Supply Chain vs. Content Ecosystem

It’s important to make the conceptual distinction between your ecosystem and 
your supply chains, because confusing them can lead to poor architectural 

The Technology that Supports Content Operations  129

decisions  that  result  in  future  limitations.  You’re  building  an  ecosystem, 
and inside it there will be supply chains. Every set of systems and processes 
that  take  content  from  origination  to  consumption  is  a  supply  chain—
with  the  awareness  that  content  is  never  “done.”  It  has  to  be  maintained, 
reviewed, updated, or retired. The totality of the connected technologies is  
your ecosystem.

The  most  common  case  of  confusing  supply  chain  with  ecosystem  is 
when  a  group  views  its  entire  implementation  through  the  lens  of  a  sin-
gle  target  supply  chain.  In  this  case,  the  group  will  often  choose  the  least 
expensive  technologies  to  support  that  single  supply  chain.  When  future 
supply  chains  need  to  be  added,  these  technologies  often  fail  to  meet  the  
new requirements. 

Architecting Confidence to Achieve Agility

The ability to move quickly is intrinsically linked to how confident you are in 
the outcomes produced by your systems and processes. This is fundamental to 
ContentOps implementations, but often it’s not top of mind. 

Confidence  in  the  content  and  the  user  experience  of  the  systems  
delivering  that  content  is  what  allows  you  to  publish  content  with  agility 
and  at  a  rapid  pace.  Every  bit  of  uncertainty  in  any  element  of  the  final  
content  product  introduces  quality  control  steps  into  the  process  that 
increase  time  to  market  and  total  cost  to  deploy.  A  good  ContentOps  
implementation  provides  an  organization  with  a  method  of  producing  all 
necessary content products with the least cost and time between the decision 
to  publish  and  the  content  being  consumable.  To  achieve  this,  confidence  
needs  to  be  actively  considered  throughout  the  planning  and  implemen-
tation  of  the  system.  You  have  to  actively  architect  confidence  into  your  
ContentOps ecosystem.

Offered vs. Published

One  of  the  key  aspects  of  a  content  supply  chain  is  how  the  source  content 
actually becomes user-facing content. Broadly speaking, there are two different 
ways this can happen: offering and publishing. 

Offered content refers to the process of making content available over an API 
and allowing apps to retrieve it as needed. Published—or delivered—content, 
on the other hand, is when a system builds content into a static package that is 
moved to another location independent of the system that built it. Both meth-
ods have their purposes, and there are situations where the line between these 
two methods is blurry.

130  Content Operations from Start to Scale

Benefits of Offered Content

• Makes  at-scale  personalization  possible  (for  a  deep  dive  on  personaliza-
tion  and  ContentOps,  please  see  the  chapter  from  Jeffrey  MacIntyre  in  
this collection).

• Automates the process of propagating changes.
• Simplifies  integration  with  other  systems,  enabling  omnichannel  content 

workflows.

Benefits of Published Content

• Creates artifacts.
• Works  well  with  standard  content  delivery  networks  for  maximum  

performance.

• Can be good for offline or other situations where portability is important.

The Components of a ContentOps Stack 

At a very high level, every ContentOps stack has four main components:

• (Structured) content
• Content source
• Content services
• Delivery apps

ContentOps Supply Chain

Each of the components of a ContentOps supply chain (as in Figure 8.1) has a 
set of functions and responsibilities. 

Expanding  into  each  of  these  major  components,  we  get  something  that 

looks more like Figure 8.2.

Next, we can add some surrounding systems to start visualizing an ecosys-

tem, as in Figure 8.3.

The Technology that Supports Content Operations  133

Content Source 

The  content  source  is  really  the  foundation  of  the  ContentOps  supply  
chain. Advanced ecosystems can have multiple content sources, but most ini-
tial  supply  chains  will  have  a  primary  content  source.  If  you  do  have  multi-
ple content sources, you’ll need to have a plan for normalization, federation,  
or orchestration.

Create

ContentOps infrastructures rely on structured content, which means that they 
rely  on  structured  content  authoring  tools.  These  tools  can  be  simple  web-
form-style inputs, which are common for graph-based/digital modeling infra-
structures.  Or  they  can  be  more  sophisticated  environments  for  generating 
XML (eXtensible Markup Language) content. 

The create stage can be an integrated part of the content management system 
that stores the source content. Alternatively, it can be composed of completely 
separate standalone tools, which are connected via API or workflow. Integrated 
authoring  environments  have  become  very  common  components  of  a  web  
content management system (CMS). However, with enterprise-wide systems, 
it’s common that one authoring environment won’t be sufficient for all users,  
so  implementations  often  use  a  combination  of  integrated  and  standalone 
authoring tools.

Regardless  of  the  interface  used  to  create  the  content,  the  most  important 
consideration is that it natively creates content in adherence to the information 
architecture.

Manage

If  the  content  source  is  the  foundation  of  the  ContentOps  supply  chain,  the 
CMS is the bedrock of that foundation. The CMS needs to do much more than 
just store the content, though. Among those considerations are the following:

• Storage
• History
• Links
• Metadata/content typing
• Access
• Workflow
• Governance
• Tracking/analytics/reporting

134  Content Operations from Start to Scale

Every  system  is  going  to  implement  these  things  differently.  Since  this  
functionality is generally considered table stakes for any modern ContentOps 
system, it’s unlikely that any of these capabilities will be entirely missing from 
a  chosen  system.  Instead,  it’s  more  a  matter  of  validating  that  these  func-
tions work in a way that accomplishes your organization’s goals. This is one of  
the  places  where  a  request  for  proposals  (RFP)  process  can  be  dangerous. 
If you simply view these as checkboxes, every vendor will check them. This 
doesn’t mean that every vendor will satisfactorily serve your needs. Be sure 
that you understand the true behavior of the CMS functions before finalizing 
your decision.

As a side note, if you’re choosing an XML approach, the ISO 26531 standard— 
Systems and software engineering: Content management for product life cycle, 
user  and  service  management  documentation—dictates  the  most  important 
functionality. It’s worth checking out. 

Connect

Modern ContentOps ecosystems are continually evolving into multiplatform 
software  implementations.  It’s  critical  that  the  key  technology  components 
have the right APIs to support current and future components of the ecosys-
tem. APIs become the basis of the apps and integrations that your team builds 
in  the  future,  so  in  many  ways,  the  total  potential  of  a  content  ecosystem 
is  the  sum  of  its  available  APIs.  The  content  source  must  have  APIs  avail-
able that allow access to the core features it provides around content man-
agement. Beyond that, the necessity for other APIs depends on the needs of  
your organization. 

Not all of these APIs need to be provided by the content source; in fact, many 
of them, especially read-only, will be built on the content services. At its core, 
that’s really what I see as content services—it’s an API and surrounding utilities 
and functions.

As of this writing, most APIs are either RESTful or GraphQL. A comparison 
between these two types of APIs is beyond the scope of this book. Suffice it to 
say that both have their advantages; your organization should evaluate them 
against their likely usages. 

Content Services

Content services come in a wide range of configurations. On the simplest end 
of  the  spectrum,  you  might  have  a  PDF  that  is  distributed  to  users.  A  more 
modern  implementation  would  be  a  well-documented  API  that  provides 

The Technology that Supports Content Operations  135

appropriately permissioned access to content and associated metadata as JSON 
and HTML. The reality is that most ContentOps implementations will have a 
variety of content supply chains that may or may not leverage multiple content 
services layers. 

Delivery Apps

Anything  that  a  user  uses  to  find,  read,  or  otherwise  access  content  is  
a delivery app. Mature ContentOps implementations will have many deliv-
ery apps. In fact, some of those apps will likely be the products the content  
is supporting. 

Avoid creating substantive content in your delivery systems and apps. One of 
the most common examples of this is when groups create content in a learn-
ing management system (LMS). This is probably also one of the most forgiv-
able, but it still carries all the problems of point system authoring. This content 
becomes an island. At best, it will be inconsistent with content created in other 
systems; at worst, it will be inaccurate or out of date. 

Source Content Format 

In your ContentOps technologies, the content itself has technology impacts.  
If you take nothing else away from this chapter, it should be that the choice 
(or your lived, operational reality) of content formats is the most consequen-
tial  choice  an  organization  can  make  when  implementing  a  ContentOps  
ecosystem.  This  choice  is  typically  made  alongside  other  information  
architecture decisions, but as the source format is directly connected to the 
content  systems  you  implement,  it’s  good  to  look  at  them  from  a  technical 
perspective here.

All  content  formats  have  advantages  and  drawbacks.  The  more  rigid  your 
structure, the more predictable it is for users and developers—and the more 
challenging it is to accommodate unforeseen cases. The more semantic your 
content,  the  more  future  ready  and  searchable  it  will  be,  but  it  will  also  be  
more challenging for infrequent authors to contribute to.

There are really four dominant approaches to the actual source content format:

• Proprietary formats.
• Text-based formats, predominantly Markdown and reStructuredText.
• Graph-based, generally via a headless system.
• Tree-based, generally through XML standards, predominantly the Darwin 

Information Typing Architecture (DITA).

136  Content Operations from Start to Scale

HTML—Special Note

You’ll notice that I didn’t list HTML here as a separate content format. This is 
a debatable position. In my view, HTML isn’t a source content format; though 
it  is  often  used  as  the  basis  for  proprietary  formats,  it’s  really  a  presentation 
format. My position is that when HTML is used as the source content format, it 
is either constrained to meet the needs of the tool or system, thereby effectively 
becoming a proprietary XML format, or its use in this way doesn’t align with 
the goals of ContentOps, because the author is creating single-channel content 
in the presentation format.

Proprietary Formats

The one piece of universal advice that I feel confident providing is to avoid 
proprietary formats. Proprietary formats will lock you into a vendor’s tool-
set and network, which creates a lot of risk and almost always ends with a 
painful and expensive conversion at some point in the future. Additionally, 
be wary of vendors that claim export compatibility with open standards as 
a substitute for true compliance with a standard. This can be tricky to suss 
out,  so  it’s  often  good  to  engage  a  knowledgeable  third  party  to  help  with 
this process.

Text-Based Formats

Text-based formats are another interesting case. They come in a lot of differ-
ent  flavors  and  can  often  be  sub-components  of  other  content  formats.  For  
example,  they  are  often  integrated  into  digital  modeling.  But  some  viable  
ContentOps systems do use them as standalone content objects that support 
the entire use case. 

In  the  case  where  the  ContentOps  system  is  designed  to  work  exclu-
sively  with  a  text-based  format,  this  is  typically  a  docs-as-code  (Holscher, 
n.d.) approach to ContentOps. We’re not going to delve too deeply into the 
usage or implementation of these systems here for a few reasons. First, these 
systems tend to be either very simple and single-purpose, or very complex 
and homegrown. The single-purpose version of these systems can be effec-
tive for a group’s immediate needs and can be fairly classified as ContentOps 
implementations, but since this rarely scales up to support the broader goals 
of  ContentOps,  it’s  not  really  in  the  scope  of  this  book.  The  very  complex 
and  homegrown  systems  aren’t  something  we  recommend,  so  we  won’t  be 
 spending time there either.

The Technology that Supports Content Operations  137

Graph-Based Content

The term “graph-based content” isn’t widely used, but it’s the most implemen-
tation-agnostic way of describing content based on an information architecture 
where content is flat, discrete units that connect based on typed relationships. 
Most often these are the result of digital modeling, which provides the content 
blueprint for describing other objects. One simple example might be a concert 
venue modeling a show. The show would connect to tickets and performers, 
which may then connect to other things, thus forming a graph. 

Tree-Based Content (XML)

Tree-based  content  is  really  just  another  way  of  saying  XML.  XML  is  based 
on tags and allows for nesting content structure and semantics, and this nest-
ing creates trees. XML is widely used in many content and data applications—
web pages being a great example. HTML is just a defined subset of XML. As it 
relates to ContentOps, XML is an ideal format for technical and knowledge-
style content. 

Digital Modeling

Digital  modeling  of  content  is  the  practice  of  creating  semantic  blueprints 
for  content  structures  that  specifically  describe  your  business  or  function.  
Typically, the digital modeling approach will result in a graph-style structure 
of content.

Graph-Based vs Tree-Based

To  be  clear,  graph-based  content  and  tree-based  content  are  not  mutually 
exclusive. Linking in XML can form complex relationships, and those rela-
tionships  can  form  graphs.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  they  must  form  graphs  of 
some  sort.  The  real  difference  here  is  that  linking  in  XML  tends  to  be  less 
semantic,  and  therefore  the  relationships  between  linked  objects  have  less 
meaning  (think  about  an  <a>  tag  or  @href  in  HTML).  This  isn’t  necessar-
ily  a  good  or  bad  thing;  it  makes  XML  more  flexible  for  standard  docu-
ment, component, or snippet-style content. So XML can also be the basis of 
graph-based content, but in practice it typically isn’t exclusively graph-based 
in  the  way  of  content  built  on  an  information  architecture  resulting  from  
digital modeling.

138  Content Operations from Start to Scale

Graph-based tends to work well for content that is primarily accessed on the 
basis of its relationships, but less well for content that is inherently ordered or 
human-organized. Said another way, if your content lends itself to having a table 
of contents or logically organized sections, the pure graph-based approach may 
not  best  suit  your  needs.  Inversely,  if  you  need  the  maximum  flexibility  and 
programmatic assembly, graph-based is a very powerful structure.

Implementing a ContentOps System

Vendors

Any  organization  implementing  a  ContentOps  ecosystem  is  almost  certainly 
going to be working with one or more technology vendors. Bringing vendors into 
your process at the right time is critical. When you’re making a change this large, 
getting vendor input early enough that you’re still flexible in your planning can 
be a huge help. A major pitfall that many organizations run into, especially when 
running internal request for proposal selections, is designing criteria to match 
their past workflows rather than evaluating whether new technology can funda-
mentally change their workflows. The risk this needs to be balanced with is that 
vendors can also push an organization to do it their way when this isn’t the best 
approach for the organization. Balancing the benefit of input from vendors with 
the risk it brings is key to getting the most from your relationships with them.Any 
organization implementing a ContentOps ecosystem is almost certainly going to 
be working with one or more technology vendors.

Filling in the Battle Card 

The key questions we’re going to answer in the process of filling in this battle 
card are: Where? What? Who? Why?

Pretty simple. List the places you need your content to end up in the foreseeable 
future. This doesn’t need to be complex for the battle card. 

Content

What shared rules (metadata?) will all content be forced to have to be a valid 
part of the ecosystem?

Start by cataloging the content that will flow through the ecosystem. This could 
be a fairly short list, but considering potential future sources can be time well spent.

For each type of content, answer the following questions:

• Where does this content currently exist? 
• Should it stay there?
• What is the state of the current content?
• Is it currently sufficiently structured?
• Does it currently have enough metadata to meet business objectives? 
• What is the minimum number of content source systems that could contain 

this content?

140  Content Operations from Start to Scale

• What special properties does this content have?
• What  upgrades  are  required  to  make  this  content  a  viable  input  into  the 

ecosystem?

Collaborators/Constituents 

Catalog who will be involved in the project and who will be benefiting from it. 
If the list is long, consider creating a separate document that describes each of 
these groups in more detail. 

Think through what each group may care about that doesn’t appear in the 
key  business  objectives.  If  you’re  unsure,  it’s  worth  short  conversations  with 
each group to make sure they’re aligned. Change management and consensus 
are  always  the  biggest  threats  to  successful  ContentOps  implementations,  so 
skipping  over  this  step  can  damage  an  otherwise  well-planned  and  executed 
implementation. 

As  you’re  going  through  this  step,  it’s  worth  remembering  that  for  some 
groups, the highest priority is having to tolerate as little change as possible—
and a goal here is to avoid annoying the content producers. Groups that must 
interact  with  the  system  but  are  not  direct  beneficiaries  of  the  gains  that  it’s 
providing  have  little  motivation  to  support  change.  Contributors,  reviewers, 
and other infrequent users often fall into this category. Working to understand 
their priorities and tolerance for learning new tools and methods is an impor-
tant step in the process to a successful implementation.

Key Business Objectives

Objectives are not KPIs—they are the reasons why your KPIs matter. What 
are you trying to accomplish? The degree to which you’re trying to accom-
plish it can be listed in the KPI section. Keep this conceptual. And keep the 
list short. 

This  list  is  the  part  all  key  decision  makers  need  to  agree  on.  If  there  isn’t 
agreement that these objectives are worth the resources you’re devoting to the 
project, then it will never get off the ground—or worse, it will sputter once it 
encounters the first major challenge. This sounds like common sense, but more 
than a decade of projects has taught me that it’s all too common for business 
objectives to be not clearly defined, or sometimes not even considered. 

Major Challenges

List  all  of  the  significant  items  or  events  that  are  (or  might  be)  standing  in 
your way. They can be technical or human challenges. You’ll never predict all of 

The Technology that Supports Content Operations  141

them, of course, but brainstorming some of the options up front will make you 
far better prepared for the curveballs. 

KPIs

Every organization is going to have the big three to seven things that it cares about, 
and each of these should be captured with a KPI. As variables, KPIs are best when 
they’re quantitative, as these are typically the easiest to communicate across teams. 
When it’s not possible to form a quantitative KPI, these can be qualitative and/
or binary. Binary is better than qualitative—at least for accurate measuring and 
benchmarking purposes. Binary KPIs can be statements like the following: 

• “All of our content will now have a consistent look and feel.”
• “We’ll have one search that covers all of …”
• “Now we can publish content to …”
• “We’ll now have a governance that puts us in compliance with …”

Each  of  these  statements  certainly  has  a  quantitative  impact  hidden  behind 
it, but it’s often the case that content teams haven’t been managing the “before 
state” well enough to make getting to a quantifiable improvement realistic. When 
you run into this case, it’s best to establish metrics and measurements for future 
improvement, even if you’re going to accept a binary KPI for your current project.

Plan

The  battle  card  should  present  a  good  blueprint  to  begin  planning  the  
ContentOps  tech  implementation.  From  here,  the  structure  of  the  plan  can 
be  based  on  the  style  and  needs  of  your  organization.  The  three  sections  I’d 
strongly encourage you to include are:

1.  Scope
2.  Information architecture
3.  Technology blueprint

With these three sections well defined, there is a single place in which anyone 

involved can access the key details. 

Implement

The steps in the process of implementing your ContentOps ecosystem have a 
general order, but many of them will happen in parallel. 

142  Content Operations from Start to Scale

Choose Technology

Technology selection will be a progressive process. Typically, ContentOps eco-
systems will have more than one technology to acquire, but in some cases they 
may be built around a single system—at least initially. In almost all cases, there 
will be a product or app that is the driving technology, and it will dictate deci-
sions on the rest of the stack because each following piece will need to integrate 
with it. While it’s most common (and generally best) for organizations that are 
starting from scratch to choose the content source system as the driving tech-
nology, any of the three primary pillars can be your driving technology. 

If the content source is your driving technology, it’s easy to go from the infor-
mation architecture decisions made in the planning phases, since most content 
source systems have a strong preference for which information architectures 
they’ll support. If you’re starting with content services or a key app, then you’ll 
need to be sure that you have a clear path to connect those back to a content 
source that supports your information architecture. 

When starting with a key app, such as the digital experience platform that 
has been implemented by the organization, it’s important to avoid tunnel vision 
by placing too much focus on this one component. Implementations that are 
entirely driven by a need to supply a single major app can quickly be tied into 
knots on the back end and end up with an implementation that falls short on 
future requirements.

Migrate and Upgrade Content

Most  ContentOps  implementations  for  organizations  starting  from  unstruc-
tured sources or proprietary point systems will need to do some form of content 
migration. Content migration is typically some combination of automation and 
manual conversion. The amount of manual labor required is generally deter-
mined by the complexity and scale of the migration. Complexity is driven by 
the state of the source content and the required structure of migrated content. 
Low-complexity conversion can sometimes be entirely or almost entirely auto-
mated. Nevertheless, the conversion should be approached with extreme caution, 
because it’s very common for the perceived complexity to be lower than the actual 
complexity. A mostly automated approach is always going to produce a lower fidel-
ity result than one that includes more manual effort. There are situations where 
this fits inside of the business objectives, but often a mostly automated approach 
ends with an unexpected post-conversion manual effort, which can be especially 
challenging because it’s unplanned and is harder to outsource. As such, it can fall 
to internal teams that are far more expensive than outsourced options.

It  should  be  noted  that  standing  up  the  technology  is  a  step  listed  after  
content migration. This won’t always be the case, and even when this reflects 

The Technology that Supports Content Operations  143

the  starting  point  for  each,  they’ll  run  in  parallel.  That  said,  I  have  ordered 
them in this way because when establishing a ContentOps ecosystem built on 
a widely  supported open standard, this step should be  considered separately 
from the tools that will support it. Separate doesn’t mean isolated, of course. 
The systems will always impact decisions in the content migration. When pos-
sible, however, my recommendation is to keep the content migration based on 
the information architecture.

Stand-Up and Integrate Technology

Once technology is selected and there is a clear path to moving content into 
it, it’s time for the fun to really begin. In the modern era of SaaS (software as 
a service) systems forming the bulk of our content tools, turning on the key 
components of the system is generally a quick process. The complexity arises 
from the integrations between the systems. 

Often, the chosen systems will have preexisting integrations. You shouldn’t 
assume  that  these  will  do  exactly  what  you  need.  Like  anything  else  with 
software,  this  simply  becomes  a  matter  of  discovery  and  iteration.  The  most 
important lesson to keep in mind is that some resources should be allocated 
to accomplish your goals. In many cases, this is an ongoing effort, and this is 
when organizations must be committed to persistent improvement in content 
experience. For these living ContentOps ecosystems, the initial stand-up is the 
starting line—and not a one-time event. 

Upskill and Train Users

We  all  know  that  people  are  more  important  than  technology,  and  success 
depends on prioritizing people upgrade as much as technology upgrade. Think 
of it this way: Do you have any doubt that a skilled contractor with a hammer 
would build a far better house than the average person with the most expensive 
nail gun on the market?

Training is almost always a function contracted with third-party providers. If 
you’ve built your ContentOps ecosystem on open standards, you should make sure 
to invest in tool-agnostic (but still aware of—and using—your tools) training on 
the concepts of that standard. Once key people understand the actual content and 
how they fit into the content strategy, getting tool training for daily users is a must. 
Finally,  the  most  often  overlooked  training  is  general  training  on  the  whole 
ecosystem. This is often a process that you build internally or in collaboration 
with a consultant who probably has been helping through the process. Having the 
ability to take someone through a high-level training on the ecosystem gives you 
a consistent starting point for everyone who is involved, no matter the person’s 

144  Content Operations from Start to Scale

specific role. This provides a common understanding, and when done properly, a 
common lexicon. It’s difficult to overstate the value of this education stage. 

Configure Output/UX

Some  content  will  make  its  way  to  users  through  integration  with  apps. The  
rest of the content will be deployed through systems that are primarily presen-
tation systems for the content.

The look, feel, and function of the final presentation content is ultimately the 
most important result of your ContentOps implementation. The possible num-
ber of places and presentations of content is staggering and beyond the scope 
of this chapter. The key concept I’d like to impart here is that you should work 
from source to output, not the other way around. 

A Note on GPT and AI for Content

As the first edition of this book was being prepared for publication, ChatGPT 
was released to the public, and overnight the landscape of content technolo-
gies changed in a major way. This is an extremely fast-moving technology, so 
almost  anything  written  in  a  book,  beyond  basic  explanations  of  its  funda-
mental building blocks, will likely be out of date by the time it’s read. Still, the 
impact on content professionals is too great to ignore in a book about Content 
Operations, so I will attempt to lay out some initial thoughts here.

As of this writing in June 2023, GPT (generative pre-trained transformer) AI 
(artificial intelligence) has gone through an exploration that has revealed many 
interesting and surprising strengths and some significant weaknesses. So with 
the  understanding  that  we  don’t  know  what  the  terminal  capabilities  of  this 
round of AI technologies will be, here is  where  it presently  appears GPT/AI 
systems perform well with content related applications: 

• Creation of tasks when the output is highly structured and many examples 
are widely available. Programing in popular languages and creating DITA 
XML structures are examples of this.

• Creation of tasks where accuracy of the output is unimportant and the goal 
is  generating  a  “creative”  work  or  a  starting  point.  Image  generators  and 
presentation creators are both great examples here, but anything that comes 
of ChatGPT also fits this categorization. 

• Summarization of “medium”-sized, discrete chunks of content. In practice, 
this means you can feed an AI model a dozen or so pages of content, ask it 
a question, and it will generally provide a good answer derived from that 
content.  This  contrasts  with  asking  a  question  to  a  large  language  model 

The Technology that Supports Content Operations  145

without giving it the content to pull from. In this case, the current GPT sys-
tems (ChatGPT 4 being the leader at the time of this writing) are not highly 
reliable. This problem is commonly referred to as hallucination. 

• Anything  prediction-based.  Especially  when  purposefully  built  (trained), 
current AI systems seem to be very good at pattern matching and sorting. 
For content professionals, the most immediate use that comes to mind is 
metadata enrichment of content objects.

Additionally,  it’s  almost  certain  that  there  are  several  narrow  automation 
applications  for  AI,  which  will  be  organization  specific.  AI  seems  to  be  very 
good at single-step functions in domains that have well-structured rules with 
plenty of examples in the public domain. Ask it to do something discrete and 
it will do it if it’s within its domain and span of control. The best way to think 
about this aspect is to imagine that you have the world’s fastest and most knowl-
edgeable assistant available to you, but this assistant has no grasp of strategy or 
multistep thinking. When you run into manual work that involves repetitive, 
complex, single-step operations, this may be a good candidate for AI.

Conclusion

While ContentOps is not technology, technology is both the enabler and the 
limiter of a Content Operations practice. Since a formalized ContentOps team 
and process will be organized around the capabilities of the tools in use, tech-
nology  choices  are  a  fundamental  part  of  implementing  ContentOps.  Teams 
need  to  find  a  balance  between  designing  a  theoretical  ContentOps  practice 
that doesn’t consider tools and designing one specifically around tools.

Epilogue

You’re Here because of People

Jonathan McFadden

When  Carlos  Evia  asked  me  to  pen  this  epilogue  and  take  a  strong  position 
on the interplay between content and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), I 
wanted to curl up in a corner and cry. As I sat at my keyboard, I realized I had 
perhaps said “yes” too quickly.

I’m not a Content Operations professional, and I’m not an academic writer. 
I’m a content designer whose foray into this industry came by way of journal-
ism, marketing, and content strategy. I’m a relative newcomer. What do I know 
about the intersection between ContentOps and DEI? All I know is that I’m a 
DEI loudmouth who’s delivered a few presentations, written a few articles, spo-
ken on a handful of podcasts, and helped found an employee-led DEI group at 
a company that I’m now two jobs removed from.

I don’t have any certifications. I don’t lead workshops. I don’t consult. I’m no 

expert. I just talk about it because I care about it.

And then it hit me: I care about it, which is precisely why I needed to write this. 
While I don’t possess the vaunted pedigree of the authors whose thought leader-
ship fills this text, I do possess a quality that makes me uniquely positioned to 
offer commentary on this crucial topic. I’m a human whose life experiences have 
been shaped, influenced, and impacted by harmful, offensive content.

148  Content Operations from Start to Scale

I’m  willing  to  bet  it’s  the  same  for  you,  too.  Why?  Because  harmful  con-
tent exists in way too many places: apps, websites, billboards, TV shows, sig-
nage,  building  design,  your  neighborhood,  your  job.  It’s  so  ubiquitous  that 
it’s nearly unnoticeable. And it’s nearly unnoticeable because we’re just now 
entering an era where more people are beginning to identify and unpack the 
potentially damaging effects the content they create can have on the people 
who digest it. 

When  I’m  doing  my  job  well  (which,  I  hope,  is  more  often  than  not),  my 
thoughts don’t dwell on the what as much as the who. Who is experiencing this? 
What are they feeling? What are they doing while they experience it?

Developing  strategies  and  methodologies  for  operationalizing  the  way  we 
make content is important. But it’s not the reason you’ve come here—not the 
only reason, anyway.

People. You’re here because of people.
More  specifically,  you’re  here  for  the  individuals  who  consume,  use,  and 
interact with the content you create to accomplish tasks, meet goals, and fulfill 
obligations. They’re the lifeblood that drives content creation in the first place. 
Like the content we make, these people exist and experience the world differ-
ently, living their lives and filling space within an array of social, cultural, politi-
cal, and physiological contexts. And our ambition to engineer and execute on 
content that resonates with as many people as possible, in spite of their afore-
mentioned variances, relies on our ability to tap into these contexts, understand 
them, and deliver information in a way that helps, motivates, and empowers. 

This  is  an  idealistic  and  perhaps  saccharine  way  of  thinking  about  a  job 
designed to serve business goals and generate revenue (I’m the first to confess 
that I’m preachy). Still, even though our work often happens in the confines of 
corporate settings, I don’t believe our content functionally exists within enclo-
sures. It leaps from digital devices to inhabit the micro-moments of our end 
users’  daily  habits.  It  builds  digital  communities  where  real  life  is  constantly 
happening. And for better or worse, it fuels experiences—good and bad.

At its best, content that keeps inclusivity in mind amplifies trust and fosters 
belonging. It builds bridges, creates connections, and respects its users. At its 
worst,  it  diminishes  identity,  perpetuates  systemic  harm,  and  incites  cruelty. 
The worst is what we want to avoid.

That’s why this epilogue focuses less on processes and procedures and more 
on  the  inclusive  content  principles  that  should  undergird  them.  Because  we 
create for people, we must approach our work with a laser-sharp focus on DEI, 
which concerns itself with the representation and presence of people who differ 
in regard to age, race, gender, ability, sexual orientation, language, geography, 
and more.

These are the people who consume our organizations’ content. They’re not 
monolithic. They  don’t  feel  or  think  or  believe  or  exist  the  same  way  we  do. 
Yet we make content for them. And if we’re not conscientious and careful, we’ll 

Epilogue  149

make stuff that adds to the orchestra blasting an all-too-familiar refrain to mar-
ginalized people: You don’t belong here.

People First, Content Second 

Because content doesn’t create itself, I consider it a reflection of the people who 
create it and a testament to their choices during that creation process. That’s 
why it makes such an indelible impact on the people exposed to it. 

Content is created by and focused on people. That means it always has, and 
always  will,  find  its  place  at  the  nexus  of  diversity,  equity,  and  inclusion.  It’s 
inherently a DEI matter because content is inherently a people matter. The two 
don’t merely exist in parallel. They are inextricably linked. The good news is 
that many of us who do content are paying attention and catching up. 

Entire books have been written about implicit bias and the role it plays in 
product design. I strongly recommend you purchase Design for Cognitive Bias 
by  David  Dylan  Thomas  (2020),  who  explores  how  we  can  use  those  pesky 
mental shortcuts to craft more inclusive experiences for our users. 

Just like a major tech company’s facial recognition algorithm can offensively 
misidentify darker-skinned people as gorillas (BBC News, 2021), content prac-
titioners’ failure (or worse, unwillingness) to acknowledge, own, and confront 
their biases will inevitably show up in whatever content they create. These mis-
fires  don’t  happen  inadvertently.  They’re  historic  and  systemic—the  result  of 
a team, organization, or person’s failure to prioritize inclusivity as a mode of 
working in content development.

Creating  inclusive  content  represents  a  commitment  to  creating  humane, 
responsible, equitable experiences. To borrow from Webflow’s blog, it means 
“providing a safer experience for more people. It’s not a badge of honor you 
earn with a single initiative or intention—it’s an ongoing and intentional effort” 
(Kirchner, 2021).

Oftentimes,  conversations  about  inclusive  content  start  with  the  content 
itself. We find chatter about the importance of inclusivity and accessibility on 
LinkedIn posts and conference stages. Well-established content teams at some 
of  the  world’s  largest  technology  companies  have  created  guidance  around 
inclusive language in the form of style guides or addenda to existing writing 
manuals. 

I praise these efforts. They’re important. Necessary. But they’re only a frac-
tion of the real work that needs to happen to ensure that creating equitable and 
inclusive content becomes second nature.

We don’t need to start with the content. We need to start with the people who 

make it. 

In the corporate landscape, where a lot of content work happens, intentional 
efforts to focus on people have gained considerable traction. Over the last few 

150  Content Operations from Start to Scale

years, corporations the world over have started to recognize the value of inte-
grating diverse and inclusive practices into their business models, drawing a 
direct correlation between diversity and inclusion and increased revenues. 

An  ample  amount  of  scholarship  exists  to  offer  evidence  on  DEI’s  impor-
tance in the workplace. Some notable research, including studies authored by 
McKinsey & Company, shows that companies making a deliberate investment 
in representation at leadership levels experience a higher likelihood of finan-
cial outperformance. One oft-cited McKinsey study, published in 2020, shows 
that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on their executive teams 
were 25% more likely to enjoy higher-than-average profitability than compa-
nies in the bottom quartile (Dixon-Fyle et al., 2020). It goes on to show that 
companies with ethnically diverse leadership teams reported a 36% uptick in 
financial performance over companies in the bottom quartile. 

For  companies  looking  to  attract  and  retain  top  talent,  DEI  has  become  a 
vital part of the employee experience. A 2021 report from job review website 
Glassdoor  shows  that  76%  of  job  seekers  and  current  employees  consider  a 
diverse workforce an important factor when weighing companies and job offers 
(Glassdoor Team, 2021). Nearly half of those surveyed said they wouldn’t apply 
to  a  company  if  there’s  a  lack  of  diversity  among  its  workforce:  those  num-
bers were especially high among Black and LGBTQ job seekers (41% for both 
groups). 

How  do  these  endeavors  shape  our  content  teams,  which,  anecdotally,  are 
still mostly white? Actual demographic data for content strategists and content 
designers  are  hard  to  come  by,  but  according  to  the  2016  Design  Census  by 
AIGA (the professional association for design), 73% of the surveyed designers 
were white (Howarth, 2017). In 2021, AIGA identified addressing and advanc-
ing diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility efforts as an ongoing opportu-
nity area in the design community (AIGA, n.d.). 

If we’re to believe that the demographic makeup of an organization’s lead-
ership  team  has  a  direct  influence  on  its  financial  output,  shouldn’t  we  also 
assume that the demographic makeup of a content team has a direct influence 
on the content its people create?

In the wake of the 2020 murder of George Floyd, I observed a shift in work-
place emphasis on DEI. This visceral, videotaped instance of racialized violence 
riled the globe, forcing the United States in particular to confront and reckon 
with  its  history  of  racism,  widespread  inequity,  social  injustice,  and  white 
supremacy.  As  a  result,  company-sponsored  equity  workshops  and  diversity 
surveys  mushroomed  into  candid  conversations  about  the  perils  and  ills  of 
white supremacy and systemic racism. Corporations frantically raced to release 
their diversity numbers, and corporate communication teams authored beauti-
fully crafted statements that live in perpetuity on their social media pages.

That same tide of introspection swept over the content community, bring-
ing  a  flood  of  conversations,  presentations,  books,  and  blogs  about  inclusive 

Epilogue  151

content and methods for expunging racist, ableist, ageist, sexist, homophobic, 
and other harmful language, components, and biases from products their com-
panies created. Perhaps with more stark clarity than ever before, content prac-
titioners  working  on  products,  websites,  blogs,  videos,  social  media,  and  the 
like began to unpack the ripple effect the content they create has on the people 
who absorb it.

I don’t mean to suggest that this is a new conversation. Content folks were 
talking about inclusivity and equity in the industry long before George Floyd’s 
murder.  But  as  2020’s  pandemic-borne  restrictions  forced  many  of  us  to  sit 
with our feelings and confront the ugly truths about racism, those discussions 
elevated to enterprise levels, placing a lofty responsibility into the hands of eve-
ryone who creates content.

Now,  a  few  years  removed  from  George  Floyd’s  death,  has  our  content 
become  more  inclusive?  Maybe.  There  are  certainly  more  inclusive  language 
guidelines. But how do our teams look? Can we affirmatively report that con-
tent has become more inclusive when content teams and content leadership, by 
and large, remain relatively homogenous? I’m not so sure.

Diversifying our content teams reduces homogeneity and offers the benefit of 
fresh perspectives, new ideas, different skills, and more engaged teammates. All 
those ingredients combined make for a potent mix that will invariably shape 
content strategy, content development, and the people to whom we serve con-
tent experiences. 

Creating and advocating for inclusive content should be part of every content 
job description, just as it should be baked into any framework we use in the way 
we work. This philosophy extends to our talent as well. Content creators should 
represent  a  diverse  cross  section  of  backgrounds,  experiences,  abilities,  lan-
guages, and thinking styles, for example. Diverse content teams make diverse 
content,  bettering  our  chances  of  connecting  with  and  appropriately  serving 
the vast array of people using our products. 

What’s at Stake if We Don’t Act?

By now, you may have realized that content doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It’s a liv-
ing, breathing organism with real-life implications.

Content sends powerful psychological signals that help people understand 
whether the experience they’re presented with is safe and welcoming or dan-
gerous and threatening.

Those signals can be stark and clear, or they can be subtle and covert. Either 

way, they exist.

• We find them in the use of the words “master” and “slave” to describe the 

interdependent relationship between files. 

152  Content Operations from Start to Scale

• We  find  them  in  button  text  and  acronyms  that  are  incompatible  with 

screen readers.

• We find them in résumé-scanning algorithms that show strong bias against 

women.

• We  find  them  in  hurtful,  dehumanizing  words  like  “alien,”  “invalid,”  or 
“other”  appearing  in  online  forms  in  reference  to  someone’s  citizenship, 
name, or gender identity.

In 2021, I partnered with  Art Schwartz-Restrepo,  a  fellow  senior  UX con-
tent  designer,  to  deliver  a  presentation  at  Confab,  a  leading  content  strategy 
conference.  We  discussed  ways  we  could  use  content  to  advocate  for  under-
represented  users,  or  rather,  people  who  have  been  historically  harmed  and 
marginalized by institutions and systems that diminish their personhood. Our 
goal was to demonstrate that people working in content—no matter where in 
the  life  cycle  they  begin  exercising  their  influence—possess  the  capability  to 
engender equity and humanity in products. 

We used a case study from Stanford and Cornell Universities as a linchpin 
for our argument. In that study, researchers found that content created for a 
series of Facebook ads urging signups for online STEM (science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics) courses inextricably affected the viewers’ ambi-
ent belonging, a psychological term referring to the feeling people experience 
when they feel like they are connected to and accepted by a particular group 
or community. The study found that when gender-inclusive verbal and visual 
cues  were  paired  in  the  ads  (for  example,  with  images  depicting  a  variety  of 
women as students and ad copy assuring the audience that women were part  
of  the  target  demographic),  course  enrollment  among  women  increased  by 
18%  without  reducing  engagement  among  men.  However,  when  those  cues 
were removed and less-inclusive imagery and text were rendered instead, such 
as  a  stock  image  of  a  laptop  displaying  binary  code,  the  number  of  women 
enrollees dropped by 8% (Kizilcec & Saltarelli, 2019).

When  Art  and  I  started  work  on  our  presentation,  we  discussed  the  psy-
chological impacts signs like “Whites Only” or “Colored Restrooms” must’ve 
had on Black people living in the Jim Crow–era south, when segregation and 
discrimination  were  codified  as  the  “separate  but  equal”  lie.  Our  contention 
was that while the meaning of those words—of that content—was evident in 
physical spaces, the words likely had farther-reaching psychological ramifica-
tions that couldn’t be detected visually.

That argument didn’t make it into the presentation, but I still believe it holds 
water. Content has long-lasting impacts on the psyche, even when the moment 
has passed. 

I  know  this  because  I  grew  up  with  parents  who  were  children  in  the  
sixties, near the tail end of the civil rights movement, but came of age as race 
relations in the United States slowly shifted. My father grew up in Lake City, 

Epilogue  153

South  Carolina,  and  my  mother  in  Brooklyn,  New  York—two  very  different 
parts of the country racked by violence as integration grew normative.

And while some things did change, much didn’t. My dad remembers the res-
taurants that were only for white people and the looks he’d get when he dared 
to cross into their world. My mom recalls the streets and subway stops where 
classmates chased her because of her hair and skin. Although they’re decades 
removed from those incidents, the memories remain vivid and visceral.

Content we create may come and go, but it has permanence. It leaves impres-

sions. It leaves feelings. And it can leave pain.

You Work for People

Designing and creating content for people requires a profound understanding of 
its power. These aren’t just words on a page. This isn’t just an interaction or anima-
tion. We’re not just building intricate user flows, e-carts, or checkout experiences. 
We’re making space where real life happens, where real people form relation-
ships, practice commerce, sign up for flu shots, and order food while they’re 
quarantined at home. What we create affects them in very real ways.

Content work, no matter its flavor, requires an empathetic bent and a deep 
understanding of the implications and consequences of that content. And con-
tent teams, no matter the industry in which they sit, need to reflect the range of 
intersectional identities, backgrounds, experiences, abilities, and languages of 
our users. An inclusive team is not foolproof. It’s not a fail-safe against creating 
harmful things, but it does yield benefits that homogenous teams don’t. Differ-
ent ideas. Different perspectives. Different experiences. Together, all these fuel 
better experiences that are more human, more empathetic, and more inclusive. 
Committing  to  very  human  ideals  like  diversity,  equity,  inclusion,  accessi-
bility,  belonging,  and  representation  isn’t  simple.  Such  commitments  require 
behavioral change, and change—even the right kind of change—is tough.

But it’s not impossible. We can do this if we care enough to do it. We can make 
content  a  more  inclusive  community  and  practice  if  enough  people  do  more 
than endorse the idea—if they actively champion its continuity and success.

We’ve got work to do. Are you in?

Jason Swarts

This was a good idea for a book. The essays collected in this volume all speak 
with  wisdom  and  clarity  about  the  issues  and  practices  of  ContentOps,  and 
the overall message is especially meaningful to me, as an academic who trains 
technical communicators. As Carlos Evia mentions in his introduction, we are 
kindred spirits in academia. We both belong to academic programs that teach 
perspectives and practices that reflect, reinforce, or at least rhyme with the per-
spectives and approaches outlined in these chapters. We also believe that the 
academic field of technical communication is enhanced by stronger connec-
tion  to  the  issues,  concerns,  and  methods  shaping  the  profession  of  techni-
cal communication today. Likewise, I would hazard to say that we also agree 
that research in academic technical communication can contribute to technical 
communication practice.

In  fact,  when  considering  what  I  could  add  in  an  afterword  to  an  already 
detailed and comprehensive look at ContentOps, it seemed appropriate to focus 
on an argument describing how academia and industry benefit from reflecting 
one another, especially on issues related to this field. After providing a bit of 
history, I will discuss some of the authentic connections between academia and 
industry  that  the  chapters  in  this  collection  suggest.  Specifically,  I  will  focus 
on both the practical skills and the training to which new technical commu-
nicators should be exposed; I will also talk about some of the basic research 
going on in the field that can influence how we think about issues related to

ContentOps. Following that discussion, I will lay out what I take to be the edu-
cational mission that derives from the professional practices discussed here.

Two Cultures?

Let’s start with the big issue: the “divide” between technical communication as 
a field of study (i.e., academia) and technical communication as a professional 
practice (i.e., industry). Although I have hung scare quotes around the word 
“divide,” there is no denying that the gulf between what academics write about 
and what practicing technical communicators want to read appears wide. This 
observation does not even address the point that academic journals are hardly 
a forum that attracts the attention of academics and practitioners equally. Even 
industry-focused  journals  like  Technical  Communication  have  trouble  meet-
ing that expectation (see Andersen & Hackos, 2021). The divide appears real 
and not unlike the “two cultures” divide that C.P. Snow saw in science and the 
humanities (1959).

The problem with a “two cultures” view of the issue, however, is that it pro-
motes a deficit model, supposing that one of the cultures lacks what the other 
has. It should not be that way—and it need not be that way. Collections like this 
one highlight both the places where there can be convergence between indus-
try and academia and the specific proficiencies, issues, and challenges that can 
bridge  the  divide.  Mike  Albers  argues,  and  I  agree,  that  although  we  do  not 
need to look hard to find mention of this divide, we “sincerely hope there are 
no future texts talking about the great split, as its occurrence would be a great 
loss for both sides” (2016, pp. 293–294).

For the sake of making a point, however, let’s take a moment to consider aspects 
of this divide. One element to note is the difference in motivation that leads to dif-
ferential consideration of topics that need attention. In industry settings, the need 
may be customer driven (see Kimball, 2015, p. 142) or driven by internal organi-
zational  needs.  Often  the  need  is  problem-based  and  time-sensitive,  focused 
on recurring problems that need solutions (see Johnson-Eilola & Selber, 2013). 
In academia, needs are not driven by the same motivations, but they could and 
should be. Trends in technical communication practice, like writing for reuse, for 
localization, for personalization, for findability, for searchability, and for Content-
Ops in general, characterize the skills and capabilities of technical communicators 
that are needed in the field (see Andersen & Evia, 2019).

An academic field is not sustained, however, and cannot develop a center by 
jumping from one applied problem to another. Academic research that is not 
problem-oriented may instead be motivated by more basic needs to understand 
concepts  like  audience,  context,  location,  networks,  and  collaboration—con-
cepts that do, clearly, influence practice. Not all scientists, social scientists, or 
humanists of any variety devote themselves, strictly, to applied and instrumental 

Afterword  157

purposes. Basic research must happen in a field as well: knowing for the sake of 
knowing, answering questions that are unknown for applications that we have 
not yet imagined. But regardless of the kind of research done, there is a need for 
good communication, for academics to speak to industry partners and convey 
what they know that may be of help now or of interest and potential value at 
some later date (see Albers, 2016; Andersen & Hackos, 2021).

Lest I get too far away from the subject at hand, let me tie this thread into 
the tapestry. ContentOps, as expressed and developed across these essays, pre-
sents a field of practice and study that is rich with opportunity for both applied 
research and basic research, and there are authentic connections to be identified 
at the intersection of the two. The essays in this collection present opportunities 
to identify these authentic connections and to point out the research issues that 
are revealed at the interstices. The essays are also excellent starting points for 
identifying how to train new generations of technical communicators.

Authentic Connections

I would like to elaborate a few of these connections and write about what I see 
as areas of commonality, practical issues to be solved, and basic research to be 
done. Those areas are: 

• Rhetoric and stylistics (understanding: operationalizing, localization).
• Publication  management  (understanding:  ContentOps,  governance,  

business).

• Experience design and audience analysis (understanding: customer experi-

ence, personalization, search support).

For years, I have taught a foundational, required seminar for our Master’s 
of Science in Technical Communication program. It is a course on structured, 
topic-based authoring. Students learn how to write topics using discrete con-
tent  elements  and  then  structure  those  elements  together  into  recognizable 
genre-specific content. Specifically, we learn to use DITA to build documenta-
tion projects. We learn about translation and localization and single sourcing. 
I never run out of subjects to cover and practice, but my students sometimes 
run out of patience. I mention this because I have learned that the value stu-
dents  see  in  a  course  like  this  is  almost  always  retrospective.  Some  tune  in 
right  away,  but  others  need  to  have  the  experience  of  doing  an  internship, 
applying for jobs, or working on a team of technical communicators to realize 
that there really was a need to learn how to write in topic formats, to pay care-
ful attention to word choice, to include clues in topics to aid in searchability 
and findability, and to give attention to how to structure those topics to create 
a beneficial user experience.

158  Content Operations from Start to Scale

Rhetoric and Stylistics

As the chapter on operationalizing ContentOps makes clear, this kind of writ-
ing and editing process is far removed from one in which a single author works 
in  isolation  on  a  single  publication  from  start  to  finish.  This  craft  model  of 
writing is being replaced by team-based, incremental, distributed approaches 
to writing (see Brumberger & Lauer, 2015). Aside from learning a new model of  
writing,  students  also  need  to  learn  new  ways  of  thinking  about  the  kinds  
of rhetorical work that these texts do and how that work is supported by the 
stylistic  choices  made  in  those  documents.  For  example,  many  students  ini-
tially struggle with the concept of a topic (as opposed to a document). They are 
unused to writing content that can stand alone, relatively free of context, to be 
combined with other topics into various output formats.

Students can learn the practice of topic-based writing, of course. The tools 
supporting  the  management  of  topic-based  writing  and  the  review  of  topic-
based writing can be learned as well. Students might groan under the weight 
of learning to use a structured authoring tool or learning to push and pull files 
from  GitHub,  but  those  practices  can  be  modeled  and  taught  just  as  easily. 
However, there is basic research to be done here as well. Consider, for example, 
what a topic even is. What are the characteristics of a topic-based style? What 
kind of rhetorical work must topics do to help engage readers, structure their 
use of the content, and lead them to additional content? Observational research 
can  answer  some  of  these  questions,  but  the  field  also  benefits  from  other 
approaches, such as corpus analysis, which attempts to look across hundreds 
or thousands of topics to find stylistic patterns that people doing ContentOps 
have tacitly understood to be important and have grown accustomed to using. 
With this basic research, we can discover how language choices anticipate and 
mitigate some of the problems that readers can encounter when using topics 
(see, e.g., Swarts, forthcoming).

Basic  research  on  writing  style  and  writing  choices  can  also  help  with  our 
understanding of ContentOps-like localization (e.g., Getto & Sun, 2017; Maylath 
& St. Amant, 2019). The sometimes subtle and not-so-subtle rhetorical and sty-
listic choices that writers make in presenting their content can make huge differ-
ences in the uptake and use of that information (Agboka, 2013). Close attention 
to stylistics and rhetorical process can also influence the efficiency of translation 
(Kohl, 2008) and reader engagement (Gonzales & Zantjer, 2015).

Publication Management

A  related  set  of  connections  are  highlighted  in  chapters  on  the  practices  of  
ContentOps,  on  governance  in  a  content  development  process,  and  on  the 
business  side  of  ContentOps.  In  academic  technical  communication,  these 

Afterword  159

issues show up in courses on publication management and content manage-
ment. Although classrooms are poor substitutes for the organizational cruci-
bles in which ContentOps is done in the wild, they are safe spaces where these 
practices can be modeled and made the object of discussion.

Basic research on these topics also has much to show us. In their integrative 
literature  review  on  project  management,  Ben  Lauren  and  Joanna  Schreiber 
show  how  the  literature  focuses  on  topics  like  teamwork,  collaboration,  and 
interpersonal  relationships  (2018),  but  there  is  a  need  for  additional  basic 
research on the governance and the business side of ContentOps. What are the 
most productive kinds of working partnerships to cultivate for effective man-
agement of content and review processes (see Batova, 2019)? What are effec-
tive  ways  of  managing  content  production  and  stakeholder  engagement  (see 
Sedmak et al., 2019)? Additional questions and projects are to be found within 
this collection.

Experience Design and Audience Analysis

There is also the connection between work on user experience and audience 
analysis  as  they  connect  to  topics  like  understanding  customer  experience, 
personalization, and search support. Each of these ContentOps issues presents 
clear problems of application. How do we develop content that customers are 
going to find engaging and that they will stay invested in? Here, basic infor-
mation on engagement (Khaslavksy & Shedroff, 1999) provides awareness of 
mechanisms through which engagement is built. In addition, research across 
domains of communication, such as comics (e.g., Yu, 2020) and video games 
(DeWinter  &  Moeller,  2016),  provides  lessons  about  how  communication  in 
these different media formats may employ techniques of audience engagement 
that can be adapted to the needs of ContentOps.

Personalization is also a concern that some of us have addressed in our teach-
ing, attempting to understand how to implement practical solutions like devel-
oping a metadata strategy for tagging topics and serving up that content using 
conditional  processing.  But  these  coarse  attempts  at  developing  personaliza-
tion can be enhanced further by looking at how (for example) algorithms and 
intelligent agents can process information and serve it to users (e.g., Ranade & 
Catá, 2021).

Basic research can also help us understand the kinds of experiential issues 
that arise when readers access information across a document landscape where 
content is served up on demand. Developing effective content for those kinds 
of environments depends on understanding search behaviors (Erickson, 2019; 
Pirolli,  2007)  and  how  to  respond  with  rhetorical  choices  that  help  texts  do 
more of the work to help readers adapt the content to their local circumstances 
of use.

160  Content Operations from Start to Scale

I do not mean for this afterword to give a complete overview of academic 
research in technical communication. In fact, the citations above only skim the 
surface and largely reflect my own selection of research that I find particularly 
useful in the context of trying to teach ContentOps.

An Educational Agenda

The  problems  and  situations  discussed  throughout  this  book  are  real,  excit-
ing, and challenging. One implication of this conversation is that the techni-
cal communication workplace has been transformed by technologies and pro-
cesses that support the complex work of ContentOps.

This collection of essays offers a thorough and useful perspective on techni-
cal communication work practices. All of the motivations and challenges laid  
out  in  these  pages  should  influence  how  we  talk  about  and  implement  the  
training  of  new  technical  communicators.  But  perhaps  the  most  important 
thing  accomplished  in  this  collection  is  the  very  definition  of  a  concept  like 
ContentOps as an integrative description of communication and organization 
practices that reveal to us the ways in which our profession is evolving.

Technical communication educators like Carlos and myself have a respon-
sibility to help prepare students to jump into these roles, not fully formed and 
fully capable, but rhetorically and technologically prepared to meet and under-
stand  the  challenges.  We  have  a  responsibility  to  help  our  students  compre-
hend  the  technologies  of  ContentOps.  We  also  have  a  responsibility  to  help 
them understand how work, writing, and review practices are likewise changed  
by ContentOps.

At the same time, we can promote the intellectual history of technical com-
munication as an interdisciplinary field and draw upon the methods and meth-
odologies of social sciences, communication, user experience, usability, social 
cognition, and education to learn how to create and collect useful information 
about the contexts of ContentOps as well as about the efficacy of our current 
practices and the potential for new practices. We can determine how best to 
apply methods and methodologies like observational analysis, rhetorical analy-
sis, and corpus analysis to determine effective ways of generating data about 
ContentOps and to understand how it works. The point underlying the chap-
ters in this collection is that we need effective, reliable, and consistent ways of 
looking at our documentation practices and assessing whether and how they 
are working. We need research that leads to education.

These  agenda  items  for  technical  communication  research  also  point  to  a 
need to reorient technical communication education to focus on the articula-
tion and application of deliberate design thinking (Tham et al., 2022) and to 
develop (and practice developing) heuristic ways of doing ContentOps to reach 
and engage audiences more effectively.

Afterword  161

We  must  recall,  too,  that  technical  communication  has  humanistic  roots 
(Ranade & Swarts, 2019). We have an obligation to our various publics to pay 
attention to user experience, ensuring that we give due and suitable attention 
to  issues  of  diversity,  equity,  and  inclusion  (Jones,  2020).  Users  and  readers 
remain at the center of the work that we do, even in light of the automation and 
efficiencies introduced by ContentOps.
