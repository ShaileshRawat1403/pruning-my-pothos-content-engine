# Agentic AI vs. No‑Code Automation for SMBs

## Overview
No-code tools chain apps together. Agentic AI plans and adapts steps with context. Use both; pick per use case.

## Why It Matters
- No-code = fast for fixed flows.
- Agentic = flexible, handles ambiguity.

## Prerequisites
- A clear task.
- Source knowledge in Markdown.
- A draft‑first publishing gate.

## Steps
- Start with a no-code baseline (forms → sheet → email).
- Add agent steps only where decisions are fuzzy.
- Ground agents on your `content/` index.

## Examples
- FAQ replies: agent drafts; human approves.
- Inventory Q&A: agent + rules; publish as draft.

## FAQs
**Will it replace staff?** No—agents draft; humans approve.
