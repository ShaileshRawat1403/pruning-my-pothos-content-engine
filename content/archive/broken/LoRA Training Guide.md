Thanks for making this, LoRA's are such a game changer - hopefully more people start making
them.

I don't know if you're a Civitai user or not, but people have been uploading them like crazy
(over 700 new LoRAs in the last 7 days). I think the low hardware requirements and the ability
to train them so easily in a Colab has been a real driver.

Careful a lot of the new LoRas look good but when you use them they dont produce
anywhere near what they say they do without some insane prompting

arent those loras coming with samples that have the prompts in them?

or can you give an example of "insane prompting"?

It's a matter of consistency. All you need is a handful of good images for a given
post and you have no idea if they were picked from a selection of 300 or 30.

Some loras are also overbaked and give a sort of fried look when not adjusted to
literal perfect specific settings. Typically if a lora can work at high weights
(close to 1) without having adverse unintended effects, it's well made.

Can you be a little more specific? Because if the model does produce great results
after prompting, that suggests good training of the text conditioning and minimal
bleed effect into unrelated concepts.

A LORA that shows you the trained concept no matter how you prompt (whether it
looks good or not) is not very useful.

he means someone will post a LORA of a character and itll look amazing but that
one image was cherry picked from a bunch of shit ones. and they probably used
a lot of specific prompts to get 1 decent image.

so you will get said lora. try it. and get 500 shit images cause u arent using the
right prompts. and with luck maybe get 1 decent image.

that isnt to say all lora are like that. just dont go in expecting every single lora on
civitai to be good/work. the rating system exists but because they are so new
they often have hardly any ratings/testing.

I think the other big issue is that LoRA is tightly bound to the very specific model it
was trained on and if you use another model, you have basically no chances of
getting the same result.

Forgive me for my ignorance, but what is a LoRA and how can I use it? I use stable diffusion via
night cafe and I see everyone posting about using custom trained models and I have no idea
how to get into that. I know you have to download but then once itʼs downloaded how do you
use it? Also my laptop is a bit dated and my graphics card is crap.

LoRA colabs are already fairly intuitive (click this, click that) and most of the settings are already
pre-made so you just has to run it.

Still, it seems lots of people don't know how to use them or how exactly make a dataset, so i hope
this guide helps them.

Edit:

I forgot to clarify a thing in the tutorial, apart of add the LoRA your prompt, you have to add the
trained subject in your prompt to get the best results!

In the example of the tutorial where i trained the concept "plum", i added the lora by clicking on the
image icon and got  <lora: Plum:1>  BUT apart of that i had to add the word "plum" to the prompt.

Check the last image of the guide (the one in 80's anime style), you can see the prompt at the
bottom have the lora and "plum" in the prompt.

Adding the lora alone is no good enough, the word of the subject trained has to be added to the
prompt.

I wonder if it's obvious or if i need to make a version 2.0 of this guide to make it clear.

It's quite important information and beginners could wrongly believe the LORA they just trained
are not functioning.

So I'd vote for a version 2.0.

LoRA teach the AI a concept, it doesn't need to be anime.

can you extend your guide with a section regarding training non person concepts?

like for example, what would be the best data set to train:

a specific clothing item? (a jacket)

a certain position (jumping mid air)

a style (specific painter)

there is a ton of guides on training people/characters but not a lot on other concepts

What do you recommend for the highly accurate model? (Settings / general recommendations etc)

My Lora models (real people) don't turn out good, they mildly represent the subject image.

And do you need to use a VAE while generating the image?

Also, can any models be used?

Nerdy Rodent and some other youtuber were testing at some point (so, things may have
changed by that time) and found out that LORA training is less precise than Dreambooth
training when it comes to people

on the other hand, you can extract dreambooth data and put it into LORA and this gives great
results

Do you have any tips to deal with overfit? Im training anime style characters LoRAs, If i use the
version after running for 2 epochs they look good, clothing, hair style etc. But if i try to generate
that character with different clothes i get parts or artifacts of the original clothing, If i use the
version after training for only 1 epoch It os flexible but the original clothing os kinda off

UnavailableUsername_ OP • 3y ago

How diverse is your dataset? Are the characters using the same clothing in every single image?

If all your dataset .txt have, for example,  style, white shirt  the AI might think  white 
shirt  is something of that  style .

Does that make sense? If you are training an AI on a concept, the AI will look what all the
images have in common and replicate it.

The same happened with a LoRA i trained in the past, all my dataset had the character using
the exact same type of clothing, so after i trained the LoRA and tested it the AI tried to add the
clothing to every generation. Had to diversify the dataset to make the AI stop relating a piece
of clothing to a character.

GuileGaze • 3y ago

When I train character loras, I try to get my dataset to have about 20-25% of the
images with different outfits. If possible, I'd try to find 3 or 4 more images without
the main outfit. If not, you can always balance the dataset by setting the number of
repeats higher on the alt outfit images.

I'd also try to find more overall pictures for the character. While 20 is probably
enough to get a good result, more reference images (as long as they're good quality)
will always help. I tend to strive for 30-35 at minimum.

Very nice! I have been really struggling to find a good guide for this. I have got it to where I can
actually RUN it but the having it turn out ok is another thing entirely. Did you have any
thoughts/suggestions on additional resources specifically around the different settings and why you
would use which ones?

I have a decent understanding of the underlying technology involved but not the setting
configuration specifics or nomenclature around it. So I am kind of flying blind.

Also I have seen conflicting information, in your text files do you always use comma separators like
you would with a traditional prompt? It seems like it would be a yes for sure but I have been told by
two different sources that it wasn't really required.

That's how i train my LoRA files and how many LoRA trained by other people do so too.

Most LoRA files on civitAI have a "trigger" word that make it work, in my case "plum", this is
because they were trained like a prompt.

I am curious, where have you seen people not using commas? The colab itself suggest you to
use a tagger in the section 4.4.2., and the tagger works by separating word by comma, like a
normal prompt.

So...separating by comma is the standard practice.

I did everything exactly according to the guide, reread it several times, but when I started the train,
it shows the error "No data found. Please verify arguments (train_data_dir must be the parent of
folders with images) /

This error means the script is not finding the images.

I have 2 possible solutions:

1. Check your folder structure on drive:

Is your folder strucure Concept main folder containing  5_Concept  folder (or 10_Concept) and
THAT  5_Concept  containing the images and txt files?

2. Check if the route you wrote on 5.1 colab section is wrong:

It HAS to be in the format  /content/drive/MyDrive  with the / at the start. That is aiming at
your google drive. If your dataset is there and not in other place it should look like this:

/content/drive/MyDrive/Concept

Replace "Concept" here with what you called your main folder.

Also, it is case sensitive so  /content/drive/MyDrive/Concept  is NOT the same as
/content/drive/MyDrive/concept

Check your training data directory structure, you probably skipped over something. Don't ask
me how I know.

Thanks a lot for sharing this invaluable resource and for adding a little more clarity to the subject of
LORA, some of us are really not very good at it.

repeat at all anyway?

UnavailableUsername_ OP • 3y ago

You choose the repeat in the folder name.

Here,  5_plum  is telling the script to repeat the dataset plum 5 times.

If call it  10_plum  it would repeat the dataset 10 times.

That's how the script was made, i guess the AI learn more by repeating datasets rather than
looking an image once.

20 epoch is a bit overkill... batch size 2 and epoch 1 with 100 repeats are enough and probably
better.

Completely noob question here: can I train it with full comic pages? I mean pages with multiple
panels or should I split the pages into single panel images?

Thanks!

UnavailableUsername_ OP • 3y ago

If you train it in full comic pages, you will get full comic pages as output, and the detail might
not be good.

It will probably be a bunch of wiggly squares (AI struggles to draw straight lines) and panels
with nonsensical noise inside.

What exactly are you trying to train? A comic character? A comic style?

What tips do you have for doing a LoRa about Style? How many pictures and what prompt to use in
the image description for training?

In my mind I would do something like: [artist name], [character], etc , etc , etc.... Should I take the
character prompt off? Should I just put the artist name?

sonicneedslovetoo • 3y ago

You need to use a different term for the character "plum" because the AI already knows what a
"plum" is, use a specific term for this LORA like "plumLORA" or "animeplum" something that is not
an already existing word the AI has been trained on.

I tried this ,and the first time it worked but my LORA model didn't work out very well so I gave it
another go, but when I tried again I keep getting this cascading error that repeats infinitely until it
crashes the colab notebook " FATAL: this function is for sm80, but was built with
__CUDA_ARCH__=750 "

Nevermind, apparently if you try to use the premium GPU it does this.

It is, however, incomplete. This specific guide teaches you using only anything v3. I made a

custom image cleaning/dataset editing just lmk by sending me a DM here after you upload your
images + tags on the app :)

Great image again!

One thing that definitely should be changed though is calling 15 images "fairly good" for training. 15
really is the absolute minimum to get somewhat usable results. A good range is more about 30-40
(or more depending what you're training, your example would be on the higher end because of the
complexity)

I have seen some good LoRA being trained on like 5 images when the technology was still
fresh, absolutely insane.

But yeah, i agree, i should have said 15 is fine but should have around 30, other LoRA i trained
have about 20-30 images.

I am thinking in making a version 2.0 expanding on some parts, do you think this one is
understandable? The dataset part specifically, i didn't said my dataset were a bunch of images
of an original character named "plum" which i was training on, which is they the txt says  plum, 
smile, blue skirt  etc.

It is implied, but i wonder if it confuses the reader.

Bremer_dan_Gorst • 3y ago

if you are going to redo the guide i would suggest to change the name since plum is also a
fruit, most people would understand that in this case this is a name, but most people does
not mean everyone :)

also the identifier should be rather unique, you did not have any issues related with
naming it plum?

out of curiousity, are you still able to generate your characters holding/eating a plum?

i've already replied in another comment, but it would be great to have a guide for non
person content, there are less of those

So you are running 70 images with 10 repeats?

That's quite a big dataset, much more than the average dataset on civitai. You should try with 5
repeats instead, maybe a smaller dataset.

Are you manually inputting the prompts or using a tagger?
