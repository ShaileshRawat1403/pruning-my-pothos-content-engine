# Pothos Pruning — Seed Notes (First‑Party)

Pothos (Epipremnum aureum) responds well to regular pruning. Prune to control length, remove leggy growth, and encourage fuller vines.

## When to Prune
- Late spring to early summer is ideal, but light pruning is safe year‑round indoors.
- Avoid heavy pruning immediately after repotting or during plant stress.

## Tools
- Clean, sharp scissors or pruning shears.
- Isopropyl alcohol or soap/water to sanitize blades between cuts.

## How to Prune (Safe Steps)
- Identify long or sparse vines; cut 1/4" above a node (where leaves meet the vine).
- For fullness: cut multiple vines at a staggered height to stimulate branching.
- Remove yellowing or damaged leaves back to a healthy node.
- Do not remove more than ~25–30% of foliage at once.

## Aftercare
- Wipe leaves; water lightly if soil is dry to touch.
- Provide bright, indirect light; avoid direct midday sun.
- Resume normal feeding after 1–2 weeks.

## Propagation (Optional)
- Take 4–6" cuttings with 2–3 nodes; remove the lowest leaf.
- Root in water or moist perlite/soil; change water weekly.
