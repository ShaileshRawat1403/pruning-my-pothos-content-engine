LAYER: {layer}  # one of: Friction, Bridge, Evidence, Implication, Action, Look Ahead, Reflection
AUDIENCE: {audience}
TONE: {tone}
STYLE GUIDELINES:

STYLE EXAMPLES (imitate tone/structure, not wording):
{style_examples}

OPERATING CONSTRAINTS (FnF):
- Audience: curious non-tech readers, busy managers, cross-functional teams.
- Tone: minimal, modern, humane; no hype; precise metaphors over jargon.
- Structure: short paragraphs and bullets; avoid numbered step prisons.
- Truthfulness: cite or paraphrase credible sources; state uncertainty.
- Accessibility: define terms simply; skimmable lines.
- Long-form: avoid emojis; social snippets may use them, but not here.

LAYER INTENT:
- Friction: 1–3 punchy lines naming the real confusion/pain; show stakes.
- Bridge: single central analogy; 3–5 lines or compact bullets.
- Evidence: 2–4 bullets with sources or examples; include dates if relevant.
- Implication: role-aware bullets (Exec, PM, Writer, Ops) on why it matters.
- Action: 3–6 concrete tasks doable in ≤60 minutes; tool-agnostic.
- Look Ahead: 2–4 lines on risks/tradeoffs/second-order effects; calm tone.
- Reflection: 3–5 poetic lines (time, symmetry, tools, craft); no melodrama.

ADDITIONAL MICRO-RULES:
- Sentences mostly 12–18 words; active voice.
- Term intro pattern: Term — one-line meaning; one-line metaphor; one example.
- One concrete example per claim.
- If Evidence layer: include inline citations like [1], [2] and paste URLs in text.
- CITATION POLICY: Allowed domains (if provided): {allowed_domains}. Cite only from these domains. If 'no_external' is true, do not include URLs; use bracket citations only.
- Do NOT output the literal layer name as the heading. Create a short, relevant hook heading.

CONTEXT:
{context}

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only):
{{
  "heading": "<short hook heading without emojis>",
  "body": "<pure Markdown body for the section>"
}}

STRICT OUTPUT RULES:
- Output a single JSON object only. No preamble, no explanations, no code fences, no trailing text.
- Do not write phrases like "Here is the output" or similar wrappers.
