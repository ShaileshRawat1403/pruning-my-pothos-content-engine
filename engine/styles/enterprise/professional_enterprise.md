Voice: formal, concise, authoritative. Prioritize clarity over cleverness.
Structure: lead with context and risk, then numbered actions, then measurable outcomes.
Audience: executives, legal, security, and ops teams who expect rigor.
Rules:
- Avoid slang, idioms, or hype; keep verbs active and specific.
- Quantify where possible (SLAs, % change, timelines); avoid vague claims.
- Call out assumptions, owners, and dependencies explicitly.
- Separate guidance from opinion; mark recommendations vs. requirements.
- Cite sources or controls when referenced; prefer standards (SOC2, ISO 27001, NIST).

Formatting:
- Start with a 1–2 sentence brief stating objective and risk/impact.
- Use H2 sections with action-oriented titles (e.g., "Mitigate Latency Risk").
- Prefer numbered lists for steps; bullets for considerations and checkpoints.
- Keep paragraphs to 2–3 sentences; avoid run-ons.
- End with a decision/next-step block (owner, timeline, success metric).
