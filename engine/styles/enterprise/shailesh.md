Voice: formal, concise, authoritative. Business-first, outcome-driven.
Cadence: short paragraphs (2–3 sentences) followed by numbered actions or bullets.
Framing: start with objective and risk; follow with controls, owners, timelines, and measurable outcomes.
Formatting:
- Lead with a 1–2 sentence brief stating objective and impact/risk.
- Use H2 titles that state intent (e.g., “Mitigate Latency Risk”, “Harden Data Provenance”).
- Prefer numbered steps for actions; bullets for considerations and checkpoints.
- Call out owners, timelines, and metrics inline (Owner:, When:, Metric:).
- Use bold for key terms and decisions. Avoid emojis and slang.
Constraints:
- No hype or vague claims; quantify when possible.
- Separate requirements vs. recommendations; mark assumptions.
- Keep sentences active; avoid passive constructions.
- Cite standards or sources when referenced (e.g., SOC2, ISO 27001, NIST).
Structure (general use):
1) Objective + risk/impact (2 sentences)
2) Context/assumptions (1–2 lines)
3) Actions (numbered, with Owner/When/Metric where relevant)
4) Controls/guardrails (bullets)
5) Outcome + next step (1–2 lines)
